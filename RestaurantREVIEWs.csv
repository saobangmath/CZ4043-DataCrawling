Boon Tong Kee at River Valley,"425 River Valley Road, Singapore 248324 Singapore",Bdcz,"October 3, 2019","This restaurant is overrated in all areas - quality, pricing, portion size, etc. This used to serve really good chicken rice. Not anymore!! Now it seems more focused on making a buck than on the quality of their food. The skin of steamed chicken tasted awful ... like it was from an old batch ie probably cooked too early in the morning - we were there at 1pm. The rice portion size was small and pathetic and lacked the fragrance and taste of the traditional/original Boon Tong Kee famous chicken rice. They charged you $5 for a small single portion of chicken. And then charged you separately an additional $1 for a loosely packed triangle of rice. Plain water $1...what a joke. Daylight robbery. I can see that they are now more focused on the China tourists as there were lot of such tourists arriving on SUVs. It is no longer our local Boon Tong Kee chicken rice which used to be frequented by locals and taxi drivers, when it was run by the old owners. Pity the philosophy and skills were not passed onto to the younger generation.",2,,,,,,

The service is very homely and ambiance has changed for the new era look. Chicken rice and the chicken are mouthwatering. Fried Tofu is a good try!

We were seated outside which normally would be welcomed at a place with such beautiful views of the CBD area but yesterday was the first day that the haze was over 200. So not such a nice place to be seated. Our daughters ordered three appetizers to share as they were not terribly hungry and my husband and I each ordered a main. The table/chair combo would be great for cocktails and nibbles but the chair was very low and deep (it needed a pillow for the back) so difficult for dinner. The rooftop had metal plates which were covered with an ""astroturf"" for lack of a better word. Every time someone stepped on the metal plate that part of my chair was on my chair moved which I found very disconcerting, a bit like having someone kick your seat on an airplane. I got over it but it was an annoyance. The appetizers were tapas and beautifully presented. The hummus needed a few more of the flat crisps to eat it with and the staff brought more promptly after we asked. The bruschetta was served on stale small breads and didn't win anyone over. The meatballs were, well, only two for $12 and the worst value on the menu! Honestly, a $6 meatball??? Ridiculous. It has a garlic toast on the side, made with the same stale bread from bruschetta. We saw others order the paella which was well sized and looked wonderful. My husband had the cod curry which was lovely but smallish for $40. I had the lamb which the server did not ask how I wanted cooked (it came perfectly cooked, medium rare) and was very tasty. After we called for the check, the waiter asked to see our tickets for the opera as they offer a 10% discount for dinner if you are attending an event in the Esplanade (I had noted this in my reservation request).

Orgo Bar and Restaurant,"8 Raffles Avenue #04-01 Esplanade Mall Roof Terrace, The Esplanade, Singapore 039802 Singapore",BrigitteGolightly,42166,"the view from Orgo is superb. I've been here many times and would very much like to keep this secret to myself but after hearing friends and relatives being ripped off by unscrupulous vendors for lousy drinks, I've decided to give this place a plug. Let's hope that Orgo will continue to live up to its quality. Firstly, from the top of the Esplanade, you get a beautiful city skyline which includes the Marina Bay Sands. (Personally, I find the other buildings including the Esplanade itself more appealing but the Marina Bay Sands is there - for those who want a good view.) Orgo has intimate seatings but the highlight for me has always been the drinks. The Singapore Sling is very different from the one served in Raffles Hotel. Their business blurb says that they serve seasonal fruit cocktails. The quality of the cocktails unfortunately does vary but it is usually between good and excellent. (to owners of orgo if you are reading this - perhaps you need to work on consistency). However, I've never had a bad cocktail here. I've never been a fan of Singapore Sling but the Singapore Sling in Orgo has changed my mind. Some of my friends have complained that they seem to be abstemious on the proportion of the alcohol for the drinks but hey, I rather have less of a good thing than more of a pipe cleaner. Their house wine is also more drinkable than other places.The tapas are decent. The meals are generally okay though not amazing. Hence I've only been here for drinks and tapas. The dessert can be disappointing so, save the space for a second drink : ",5,,,,,,

My recommendations is raise the price to the level you can give to an executive lunch by 10 to 20 dollars but give proper food of Garibaldi standard.

I ordered the Burrata con Pomodorini for the starter (large enough portion for 2 if you wish a lighter starter) and the Spaghetti Aglio Olio with sea urchin and grilled scallops and a portion of Spaghetti Mare. I picked the items up from the restaurant and when I served the items for dinner shortly, the main courses were still very warm. The Spaghetti Aglio Olio was exquisite as I expected and so was the Spaghetti Mare which was thoughtfully packed in a 2-tier container so that the Spaghetti was still al dente when eaten. Finished off with mama's recipe for tiramisu. Nothing was lost in the take out dinner as compared to dining in at Garibaldis.

This time I had special family reunion and I booked twice for 16 and 18 Aug. We are a party of 5 for 16 and I have to say it was the most horrendous night I have ever encountered for Michelin restaurant. There was a baby lunar month celebration in private room next to ours and I told the staff that this is no different than McDonalds kids party. Babies crying and kids screaming. Obviously all the other tables were also complaining. It totally ruined an expensive evening. To make matters worse, the cod was overcooked and cod is almost difficult to overcook. I saw that at the end of the dinner, they brought our complimentary Prosceeco for all the tables. I asked about my 18th reservations whether there is going to be another McDonald's party or not and I was assured there was none. On the 18, Naz the same server redeemed himself. I asked about the original cold angel hair dish with scallops and prawns as the new variance was too watery for me. The chef was able to prepare the original way. All the other food were back to excellent. We had another nice expensive family meal for 7. My advice for people reserving a dinner is to specifically ask whether there will be any children party or not. I am so puzzle at why the management would accept business for kid's party!",3,,,,,,

On a recent quick stopover we decided to stick close to the hotel and chose to dine at Garibaldi, a Michelin starred Northern Italian less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Garibaldi is a stunningly decorated bar and restaurant combination that clearly attracts the young and moneyed of Singapore, as well as westerners. Modern, sleek and beautiful--if only the food and service lived up to the promise of the decor! Michelin star notwithstanding, the food at this restaurant would be considered average at a good Italian restaurant in New York, our homebase. In New York, places like Felidia get Michelin stars. Garibaldi is no Felidia. Perhaps the Michelin reviewer was so wowed by the decor he/she forgot to pay attention to the food! In addition, service is cold, somewhat inattentive (when my partner asked that a beef tartare appetizer be served without the quail egg on top, it appeared egg looking cyclopically at her!) although generally effective once the waiter focused on us. The food was serviceable, but very pricey (of course this may be unfair as we are used to better food at these prices in New York). The overall feeling here was, perhaps, of a place that caters to wealthy regulars, but tends to neglect those unknown others who come through the door as not being their bread and butter.

Both ordered the signature menu which was very nice. Wagyu steak tartare with burrata proved to be a fine combination and the other dishes were enjoyable too. Wine by the glass lacks a bit of quality, the restaurant should offer better options at its price point. Bottle list looks good but not everyone can drink a full bottle in one evening. Service was also lacking on bill settlement: I paid with my creditcard and it took a long time to settle. This included leaving the invoice with my card in an open spot for some time.

Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar,"#01-02 36 Purvis Street, Singapore 188613 Singapore",Philip R,"November 25, 2018","Lunch can be a tricky meal if one is not enjoying a work-free day: eat too much, and feel lethargic in the afternoon; eat too little and feel unsatisfied, hungry even. Garibaldi is well known for its fine Italian dining, and its luncheon offerings hit just the right spot. Two of us chose a four course set, and the third a selection of cold cuts followed by a dessert only. Every dish was delightful, from aforesaid cold cuts, the beef tartare (but for the life of me, I can't see how a sliver of gold flake improves what is already an excellent dish - why do restaurants feel the need to do this?) through the pasta with white truffle shavings (it being the season), the suckling pig, and the desserts. Portion sizes were perfect. Excellent service, and an elegant and quiet ambiance. All in all, an excellent lunch which certainly wasn't a candidate for ""cheap eats"" classification, but represented excellent value for money. Whether it's business, romance, fellowship or a simple need to partake of a mid-day meal, this has to be one of the best choices.",5,,,,,,

If you're noise sensitive, request a seat in the room furthest away from their bar section as that can be a little noisy when they forget to close the glass separator door. The food is instagram worthy, but standard flavor if you're used to good Italian food. By Singapore standards however it may be considered above average. I don't think I'd return, but to reiterate their service was really good. Plates were promptly changed between courses and tables were dressed correctly.

L'Angélus,"85 Club Street, Singapore 069453 Singapore",cynthiasJ4958WG,"January 9, 2021","I think our problem is we keep wishing for the L’Angelus that existed years ago. The L’Angelus we have today is run differently. We noticed this early last year during a dinner with family, yet decided to try it again this evening with our daughter and are sad to say we will not be returning. The staff was friendly and accommodating, but service was patchy at best. Upon arriving we were told the table we requested was reserved. In the course of our first hour there, three different parties sat at that table, but we decided it wasn’t really worth addressing given the experience we were having. Once the restaurant started to become busy, it was difficult to get waiters’ attention and basic things were overlooked. It took three tries to refill our young daughter’s soda. Since she didn’t feel like eating her dinner, she agreed to share our chateaubriand at which point we were given salad plates instead of dinner plates. Our ice-cream order that meant to accompany our crepes suzette was incorrect and took a few tries to fix, at which point the crepes were cold. Cutlery was incorrect - I was given a fish fork for dessert. So many things were off and the total bill was so high and not reflective of the meal we had. Family dinners with wine tend to be expensive in Singapore, which is fine, but not when you’re agitated the whole evening about trying to reach servers, receiving incorrect orders, and then trying to correct them. To their credit, the service staff was very kind and the restaurant ended up comping our dessert for the inconvenience, which we greatly appreciated. They are not arrogant and tried to be helpful, but it was really too late for us. We miss the old L’Angelus.",3,,,,,,

The customer service is horrible and their part timers cannot assist us with orders and we have to wait for another staff to take our order. It's so lousy that our cutleries setting wrong. When we raised our hands, the servers ignored us. While the food runner was busy running with the foods, we asked for her help in changing the cutleries setting, she seems to know what she is doing. Sadly, our main cutleries got mixed up and we asked the servers to change for us but the servers got the wrong cutleries again. We got pissed off and the food runner drop by to check on us, she apologised and quickly changed it for us. We waited for our main for so long too. All the food was okay not as what we read on the review. Slightly disappointed. You need to teach those servers before the dinner starts to avoid this kind of circumstances. Surprisingly, towards our dessert, we were approached by the food runner. She was checking on us again, talked and laughed with us. She mentioned there was a freelow on escargots and we can't wait to come here again not on busy night. If not for her service, probably we won't ever come back.

Reservation made easily enough online. Kicked off proceedings with a ""Grande Ferme"" salad with roquefort cheese and bacon. The portion overall could have been more generous, as we struggled to find the bacon bits. The onion soup was tasty, and so was the highlight, the cassoulet of Toulouse. The meat portions were satisfactory but a personal preference would have been the version from Castelnaudary, without the tomato base, just pure stewed white beans. We ended with 2 desserts, a chocolate fondant paired with an extremely tangy raspberry sorbet for the missus, and the classic crème brulée in tandem with rhubarbe puree. Cannot fault either one, both were good and an excellent way to top off the dinner. This is not a bistro style eatery so expect to fork out a fair bit for a dinner for 2.

So to celebrate her graduation last night, out of all the restaurants in Singapore, L'Angelus was her choice. Never disappointing, simply great French food in a lovely fine dining atmosphere. And they now have a $68 three course menu that has a great selection. If we hadn't gone with our favorite menu items in mind we would have been tempted but we stayed with our favorites: duck liver pate, duck liver grilled and the Chicken Fricassee in a morel and truffle sauce (the recipe's on their website) which is to die for. For dessert, my daughter had her favorite hot chocolate cake with their luscious vanilla ice cream. One more thing, I'm on a low-carb diet (no sugar) and found the menu filled with possible options.

My main was a very good lamb, juicy tender rack perfectly cooked with a very very good ratatouille . My friend had the duck, a farm one, very tasty. Excellent dessert ( I had their hot chocolate cake, it's a very good one !). They gave good wines too and I understood from the manager lady they import most of them so pricing is very decent for Singapore . We got a bottle of a wine from south of France , Les Brunes , a kind of boutique wine that was superb and only 98$. Good value for money all in one .

However, when we reached the restaurant 15 mins before the reservation time, the seat was not ready. Like other walk-in customers, we had to wait. Seemingly, the walk-in customers were able to enter the restaurant much faster than we did. When the manager finally managed to clear the queue, he asked us whether we mind the counter seats. Erm... but we made a reservation. If we had not made a reservation and just walked in, then we should be fine with the counter seats given the queue. We rejected the offer, and then we were made to wait again. By our reservation time, we were still not yet seated. That defeat the purpose of having a reservation after all. The restaurant was understaff apparently. Food wise, the pork burata was awful. The pork was too grilled and dry and we find it unpleasant smell. Then we waited very Long for the yakitori platter. Most of the food were served almost consecutively except for the yakitori platter. We surmised that it was overlooked. When it finally came, we would agree that it tasted better than the pork burata. However, the mid wings were too overgrilled and we tasted the burnt taste. I had to make do by removing the skin just to eat that pathetic mid wing.

The set consists of a bowl of Japanese topped with Tempura (deep fried) Tiger Prawns, Dory Fish, Chicken Thigh, Onsen Egg, Crab Sticks, French Beans, Japanese Eggplant and seaweed. The set also comes with miso soup, chawanmushi (steam egg), appetisers, green salad and cut fruits. The set was served less than 10 minutes after ordering and it looks sumptuous. But after taking first bite on the Tiger Prawns, I was disappointed to find it greasy and crispy enough. The batter has soaked up quite a bit of oil. I tried the rest of the Tempura and they were just as greasy. The Tempura was not fried in the correct temperature and that's the reason for the greasy batter and the food absorbing the oil. I am glad that the miso soup, chawanmushi was served piping hot and the salad was refreshingly dressing with a hint of sesame, lemon and radish.

Where we always go for our crab cravings. Sadly, the service has deteriorated as its popularity has risen. We’ve been eating here since it was in a coffee shop in Serangoon. That means we go a long way back with this restaurant. This New Year evening as we queued at 5.30 pm, we were hurried through our orders. Spoken to in condescending manner by both the young man who spoke Malaysian-accented Mandarin as well as by the impatient female Supervisor who refused to give eye contact because we were slow. We couldn’t understand their confusing “ procedure” of orders in order to get seated at a Table, or waiting til our party is complete before having our orders sent to the kitchen. They were both too impatient to explain . They kept moving on to other customers while we were trying to clarify. Our food order took several attempts. I felt sneered at when we explain our smaller portion order of pork etc was because while our table was for 8 adults, the two Muslim Helpers can only eat non-pork dishes. I’ve never felt so insulted before in any other same price restaurant in better venues. As a point of interest, the two crabs we ordered cost $165. The two stars I’ve given is only for the food. Nothing else for rude service. It will be the last time I’m fulfilling my crab cravings at Melben. For the price we paid for the entire meal, we could have eaten at an air conditioned restaurant served by professional servers. We didn’t even bother to give Mr Boon Chuan the feedback. Yes, he was there but oblivious to his staff’s lack of service. Because it is a very POPULAR restaurant where you queue and wait an hour to be seated and another hour to be served with food.

Ordered the lup cheong rosti and basil chicken eggs benedicts for mains, as well as the mixed mushroom tempura as a side for sharing. The mixed mushroom tempura is a must try if you are a fan of mushrooms- a mix of enoki, portobello and shitake mushrooms all coated with a really crispy and well battered tempura exterior. A really addictive side that was polished off within no time among the both of us. The basil chicken eggs benedict was something different and special from the usual eggs benedict, with basil hollandaise over poached eggs and thai basil minced chicken instead of the usual ham/smoked salmon. The poached eggs were on point, with an explosive factor and the minced chicken were juicy and flavourful. However, more toast could have been given as all we got was just 3 tiny triangle shaped wedges that made up only half a slice of toast. The lup cheong rosti, served with scrambled eggs and salad was a disappointment with a some parts being charred. The lupcheong slices could have been more too.

There were empty tables and at least one that looked almost done but the staff told us it could be a 30-60 minute wait. I asked about the empty tables and was informed that they were reserved for 1:30pm (we were there at 1pm) and asked if we could take one of the reserved tables since it looked like one table was leaving. The staff, again unsympathetic, said they had no idea how long the wait would be. A minute later, the people at the table left and the staff shrugged her shoulder as if nothing happened.

That's when, by chance, we came across 'Ras, the Essence of India.' To begin with, the ambience of the neat and tidy restaurant by the riverside was great (we sat outdoors although there is provision to sit indoors too); the staff were courteous and served us with a smile. The preparations: Dal Makhani, Paneer and an assortment of breads (Pudina Paratha, Tandoori Roti and Butter Nan) tasted like any of the best restaurants in Delhi. We did not miss 'Home Food' at all. So delicious were the preparations that we reordered some breads and ate to our heart's content... nay, overate. Delicious indeed––the very thought of that dinner is mouth watering for us. Would strongly recommend to visitors to Singapore with a liking for Indian food. By choice we had ordered vegetarian food although non-vegetarian food was also available.",5,,,,,,

It has a feel of street dining as all the food is brought in bowls so you can share. I am a vegan dinosaur which is often problematic whilst travelling, but I am always open to try new things as I do travel with carnivores. The claypot beancurd with mixed vegetables is to this day the best thing I have ever eaten! (mainly for the fresh ginger in it). The staff even made me a noodle dish which was not on the menu but equally as delicious. I cannot fault this restaurant in any way, due to the free water, 60 pence bowls of rice and free appetizers with some amazing spicy dipping sauce (sadly I have no idea what it was, but it was great with carrots!). The carnivores just loved the honey glazed ginger chicken too! If you are staying around Orchard Road or Tanglin, definitely pay this restaurant a visit!

Excellent Crab Dish. All the meat and seafood that we tried were cooked to perfection. They are all tender, juicy and succulent The dining experiences I had at Ah Hoi's Kitchen was awesome.., although I must say it's a little pricey,.

We went for the Singapore chili crab amongst the other Singapore fair but although the food was OK...on a value for money and taste I would say find another place to get your chili crab because it is overpriced for quality and taste you get. Ambience however is good from its roof top location next to Hotel Jen pool area.,2,,,,,,

Don't be put off by the fact that it's a hotel restaurant. If you are after some good 'home' cooked dishes with rice then try this place out. There's help yourself prawn crackers and iced water to get you started. All the dishes we ordered were excellent, especially the chicken satay. The bill was cheap too which was a surprise. Only downside is that it is open plan dining so without the aircon it can be a bit warm. Other than that good service and good food.

Had the rendang chicken lasagne and cheeseburger. Asian twist to the lasagne was pretty good, substituting the usual tomato sauce with savoury rendang sauce. Could be better if there was more cheese. The cheese burger on the other hand was plain boring. A thick beef patty, cheese, lettuce tomato, onion. As the beef patty was well done, it came out more on the dry side which made it harder to stomach. This may be elevated if there was a sauce or better toppings on top of the burger. Slightly mixed experience foodwise but interest in other offerings on the menu may be what will bring me back again.",3,,,,,,

We were greeted warmly by Elisha who remembered taking my reservation and eagerly advised us on their specials/popular dishes. We decided on yutiao otak, beef rendang, coffee pork ribs, rice and kueh durian. My friend had highly recommended the buah keluak but we didn't have the capacity to include the dish. Since I am not crazy over durian, I took a slither of the kueh durian to try - durian lovers would probably love the kueh durian as it was redolent with durian scent. We liked the food and ambience. Elisha and her colleagues very conscientiously but in a non invasive fashion cleared dishes as we finished and quietly refilled our cups with warm water. No one chased us and we were able to enjoy the ambience As the afternoon shifted to teatime, we ordered hot chocolate to round off a languorous Sunday. It is so wonderful to share an afternoon in a place where everyone is welcoming. Elisha's service was excellent- she is such a genuine and obliging person. We will definitely return",5,,,,,,

Thai Express,"Temasek Boulevard, Singapore Singapore",gn123,42385,"I recently visited this restaurant in Temasek Boulevard area for lunch and from the time I entered the place I was getting a feeling that something was missing in there. I was looking for someone in the restaurant who can show me the place where I could sit, not that there was no place or it was busy, there was plenty of space and it was not busy at all, but just that its courteous to be that way for someone from the staff who could guide the customer to where they can sit. So after waiting for a few minutes I waived at someone in the restaurant who seemed to be the staff and requested for a place where I could sit. I browsed through the menu and ordered my food and the server placed the food on my table and just left without even asking if I needed anything else. I had to ask for the thai chili sauce and other condiments. Thai hospitality missing big time! Its a full service restaurant and I would definitely not expect it to be of that low service. This restaurant needs to change the name of the place, its not Thai at all, else please improve the service. You can rather go to Bangkok Jam which is not very far away from there for a nice lunch.",2,,,,,,

The order was mixed up, something was not there and the portion of the Pad Thai was the smallest I've ever seen at a Thai Express. The people were very friendly and helpful though and explained they only had one chef in the kitchen. Unbelievable they would continue to serve the whole place with only one chef. They apologized thoroughly but still one would expect something else than that. My lime juice was the worst I've ever had at a Thai Express on top of that.

Thai Express,"Temasek Boulevard, Singapore Singapore",DanielOon,42248,"Lunch with my spouse & the Heartland Mall venue was empty (giving me a sceptic suspicion of regrets later). Menu looks good with a good spread of dishes. Food came in quick, in just 10 mins. Thus far, we were hapoy until we bite into the dishes, they were bland & tasteless. The Seafood Tom Yum had a few shrimps but they were tasteless, high likelihood of frozen ones & not fresh at all. Hence, there's no flavor at all. So were the squids & fish fillet, seriously pathetic for the 'not-so-cheap' price charged to customers. Diners dont mind paying if the quality & quantity are justifiable. Even the spices were insufficient, could only see lemon grass, nothing more. There's no fragrance of a basic authentic Tom Yum, & no taste. It's like drinking clear sour water, that's about it. Management should seriously look into such matters as it completely destroys the image of Thai's good dishes especially Thai's iconic & signature dish Tom Yum. Frankly, the Tom Yum was hopeless & it's embarassing to serve such quality to customers. I reckon i could cook 10 times better than Thai Express. Next, was another iconic Thai dish ie the Pad Thai, was another disservice to its name. Most Pad Thai we had in Singapore Thai eateries, we could smell the fragrance from afar (like Penang Char Koay Teow) before reaching out table but not with this one. Again, the shrimps didnt look fresh at all & so were the peanuts. It's so ironic & unusual that we had Pad Thai but without the fragrance, how is that possible? We had the chendol with jackfruit & to out horror the jackfruit was soggy, easily broken & not fresh at all, 100% must be canned ones. Oh yes, tasteless!! We're shock how management could allow such a simple dessert could be prepared & served to customers in such manner? Perhaps, the management find this quality 'excellent' in their eyes & taste buds. This is seriously profiteering in the expense of innocent & genuine customers. We had the Roast Chicken as our starter but when it came, it didnt look similar to what's in the menu picture which has crispy skin. All in all, it was a horrible set-back & our confidence & trust on the branding instantly went into the drains. We used to patronise this branch 7 years ago & it was good, good in every way. Good in taste, good in service, good in ambience & price is reasonable to the food quality but today, it's disastrous & horrendous. No wonder, this outlet is always empty every time i bypassed when shopping in Heartland Mall. The last disgusting pointer was the Chinese speaking kitchen staff, a chubby guy, who kept repeatedly beating the counter so loudly that he was oblivious to disturbing the ambience of diners. When I told him to stop this disturbing rhythmic noise, he denied & acted as though what's wrong with his noise making. The only saving grace to our meal was the supervisor, a pleasant & efficient Malay guy. He deserved all praises. Would i return, a big fat NO WAY. Would i recommend to someone else, obviously a big NO. Food was lousy, tasteless & unfragrant. Ingredients were not fresh & inadequate. Price dont match the food quality. Unless management rise up to the occasion to change & improve, this outlet may wind up very soon.",2,,,,,,

Service (other than of course forgetting her order) was lousy as well. We decided to give it another go as a family of five. It seemed that the computerised ordering system had died as our meals came in a haphazard fashion, had to be sent back due to incorrect orders, and finally we missed out on two meals.

The positive side of the revision is that now we have an option of no quail eggs and instead a stick of Shiitake mushrooms (Set B). A good thing for the health conscious. The downside is there's a change of recipe of the chicken balls and pork with leek. The chicken balls now have more ginger in them and the pork with leek are now smothered with garlic. While my family and I prefer the old recipe for these yakitori sticks, they are still scrumptious nonetheless. With Nanbantei Far East Plaza branch, food is only one of the factors. The other two factors that keep bringing my family back are the friendly service and intimate environment that never disappoint us in making our meals there always enjoyable.",5,,,,,,

The truffle fries, served hot, was good, but unfortunately overpowered in taste and smell by the floss. The foie gras pasta tasted above average for sure, but was lacking in aroma. There wasn't much flavour in the mushrooms. Had the otah burger, which was surprisingly watery. Water oozed out of the patty when my knife cut into it. Maybe the cooking process involved steaming, which caused the unexpected juice ooze. The bun didn't do much for me either cos it wasn't crispy or buttery. Had durian alaska to end off the meal. The outer shell was wispy but sweet. The durian lacked the smell and creaminess of good durian ice cream,and the crust was a little tasteless. The lychee tea was good, though. Service was prompt, which is always pleasant. ",2,,,,,,

After we finished, I noticed that I receive only juice from dessert & soup set and no soup at all. So, I told the waiter to remove soup price from my bill before issuing bill. Then he said he would get the soup right now. What's the point taking soup after whole lunch was completed. They need their service level upgraded.",3,,,,,,
Nara Thai Singapore,"2 Orchard Turn Ion Orchard Ste #B3-21, Singapore 238801 Singapore",Ophir77,42885,"We rarely visit ION Orchard as it is such a busy place but we made special effort to dine at Nara Thai restaurant as I and my colleagues have catered from them a number of times. We did not feel much of an ambience when we arrived and were shown to the table. The service was not very welcoming and when my husband and I sat side by side rather than across each other, no effort was made to shift the placemat, cutlery and the menu to where I was seated. No drinks were offered and I had to ask for water twice. We were disappointed to learn that the chicken served were all from frozen meat and only dark meat; none of the chicken dishes offered breast meat like what we so enjoyed in Thailand. One of the wait staff was particularly sour-faced. I asked very politely for some nam pla (I have used the Thai word for fish sauce from my Thai recipe books since the 80s) and when she did not understand I said fish sauce and she replied curtly 'I do not speak Thai'. I felt the remark was most unnecessary as I only used one word. A better response from a service staff interested in being friendly to a customer would be, 'Oh I am not familiar with that word but I learnt something today'. The Thai fish cakes we ordered were delicious as we remembered from our catering. The Massaman Beef Curry was very tasty, the meat nice and tender although a bit oily. The crab omelette was alright but did not have crab flakes on the top as showing in the menu. We also each ordered a set dish that came with rice, chopped chicken with basil, a fried egg and a few cucumber slices. The waiter said he could change the white rice to the (bluish) butterly pea rice (which I always order when catering) and we appreciated that he was thoughtful and flexible only to find out later that we were charged additional $2 each for the change. We told him he should have mentioned and checked if we wanted to pay extra as we would have not since white rice costs $1.90 and butterfly pea rice $2.50. We should have only been charged at most the difference of 60 cents!! It is not the amount so much as the principle behind it. We also noted that one of the other waiters was extra pleasant to a European customer and addressed him as 'Sir' which was different from the service we received. Overall, as much as we would like to have the Massaman curry again and try some of the other interesting dishes, I doubt if we would return at least not for a while. The meal cost $102 for the two of us with only tap water to drink (charged $1 each) so a bit pricey for us. I guess for a quick set lunch where you have no time to pay attention much to service but just have time to eat and rush, the set lunches seem a good option.",3,,,,,,

Food was mediocre but the experience was just bad. Everything takes a while here. The waitresses are poorly trained as they aren't polite if not rude. In addition to the regular dishes, we ordered kids meal and it comes with an ice cream for dessert. But although we have reminded the waitresses twice to bring the ice cream, it took almost 10 minutes till they brought it out (I mean how long does it really take to scoop an ice cream and sprinkle a few chocolate on top of it?). We dined around 2pm and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. And when we asked the waitresses about our food, their faces didn't seem very nice. I wasn't alone to notice the waitresses' response but so did my wife. No wonder they're no longer rated as one of the best. ",2,,,,,,
Nara Thai Singapore,"2 Orchard Turn Ion Orchard Ste #B3-21, Singapore 238801 Singapore",asbelizabeth,42878,"Not having tasted Thai food for quite a while, I thought I will bring my mum to try out this restaurant with me. I like my usual Thai Olive Rice and the Chicken Wings stuffed with Minced Pork but to my disappointment, both of these items are unavailable in Nara. We requested for the Prawn Tom Yum Kung to be changed to Seafood Tom Yum Kung as we preferred to hv a mixture of seafood. The soup is good although not better than others served elsewhere but what is really yummy is the Yum Som O (pomela salad). I would have loved to have double portions of this as it's so appetising and much better than a lot of Thai Mango Salad. The next item is one that I have never tasted in a Thai restaurant before-it's the Kao Phad An Chan (butterfly pea fried rice $2.50). I don't know if this is an authentic Thai dish but I would definitely come back for this dish alone. We also ordered the Hors d'oeuvre Nara-Assorted Nara's Hors d'oeuvre at $17.90 featuring BBQ pork w Tamarind dip, Thai fish cakes, Pandan chicken and a small pomelo salad. This dish gives one the chance to try an assortment of Thai dishes but I find them all unremarkable.

The drinks selection was pretty alright (two kinds of beers, two kinds of cocktails) , although when I wanted to order one of their two cocktails, they told me that they ran out of the rose syrup that they use to make it, so I got their other cocktail, the siamese sour, which became a little cloying after a few sips. I would rather have gone for their iced tea since their bar wasn't very big. For the food, I got their Gai Pak Panang (spicy barbequed chicken), which was rather tough and dry, but had a tasty marinade; and their Kuay Tiew Tom Yum Kung (Tom Yum noodles with prawns), which was pretty alright - nothing too special, although the prawns were delightfully crunchy and juicy. The service wasn't too bad, although it could have been better considering there were only 4 to 5 other tables when I walked in, and the counter and other floor staff were simply standing around chatting and joking around with each other. The servers were friendly, however. I enjoyed the interior of the place, and if you're thinking of charging your phone or electronic devices there, there are power outlets at the corner of the table booths.

My expectations when someone promises me “authentic German cuisine” are therefore both: high and slightly peppered with suspicion. The latter is due to the tendency of “German” restaurants abroad to only cater to the stereotypical German dishes. German food is not only Bratwurst and Sauerkraut. Every region has their own specialties and while it is certainly impossible to cover them all on a menu, I appreciate it, if you can find at least a bit of variet ",4,,,,,,
Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,"9 Raffles Boulevard Millenia Walk #01-01 Millenia Walk, Singapore 039596 Singapore",harryt2017,"January 10, 2021","Visited with a friend in December 2020. Ordered Kasespatzle, Schweinshaxe, and Pork Schnitzel. The food quality was wonderful, with brilliantly warm and creamy cheesy goodness in the Kasespatzle, which was not jelak unlike some other places, and neither was it overly salty, which can be a problem as well. The pairing of fried onions elevated the dish by adding a crispy savoury-sweetness that goes very well to up the level of creamy cheesy sauce and the springy egg noodles. The Schweinshaxe was paired with a rich and very savoury dark beer sauce which added a nice punch to the dish, and elevated the taste of the pork knuckle. Loved the sauerkraut pairing as it was well balanced, not too sweet, not too sour, and not too salty, and not too mushy. However, the other item that was in the Schweinshaxe dish as a second side vaguely reminded me of a potato dough dumpling. That was slightly bland and a bit too doughy for my liking. The schnitzel was quite good, not greasy, and the flour batter thin enough, and meat tender and not dry. However, the pairing of fries felt a bit lacking and weighed a little too much on an already-heavy fried dish like schnitzel. Perhaps swapping for mashed potatoes or potato salad and an acidic option like a slaw or sauerkraut would make for a better option to balance out the heaviness of the dish. The Weisbier here is sublime, crisp, fruity, and refreshing, tasting like liquid gold in my opinion. However, many of the staff were quite inattentive and rather cold, even if they were efficient. Luckily there was a lady who was very nice and was very willing to help us take photos and proactively brought out extra cutlery when my friend had dropped his on the floor. Made the good food even better and compensated for the lack of friendliness on the part of her other colleagues.",4,,,,,,

Service is terrible, the restaurant staff were so bad it bordered on caricature! It was not a busy Friday night but the restaurant staff repeatedly ignored us. It took them 20 mins to bring us 2 pints of beer (we were just 2 people) and another 45 minutes for our food to arrive (cold, dry, oily roast beef and some pretty sad looking potatoes). There is no point following-up because they are experts at averting your literal cries for help! Come at your own risk.",1,,,,,,

Although I had emailed the hotel regarding my feed back on the dining experience, the manager simply just replied that my feedback would be shared with the team necessary improvement would be made. However, judging from the reviews from trip advisor posted months ago and the service I received few days ago, I do not think our reviews/ feedback on tripadvisor would result in any changes.

Gracie, the owner, suddenly came over and asked if she can move the bag, and my brother just said yes as it was rather abrupt and she was already holding his bag. That was fine, though a little strange, however it got worse as she dropped the bag roughly on the floor with a resounding bang (there was a work laptop inside). My family and I just looked at each other and when my sister confronted her, instead of saying sorry, she simply stated that “It’s protected right?” which was beyond rude as that was a valuable personal belonging and we honestly would have just let it go had she just apologised in the first place.

The waiter attending to us was very good and professional. However we were unable to consume a wonderful birthday cake for my old friend as the management charged $40 for cake corkage! Stupid idea and crazy price. In view of the price and quality of food served as well as the cake corkage, it should warrant only 2 stars but I gave them 3 just because of the young waiter.

We went to have dinner with some friends midweek. The restaurant looks very warm and welcoming, the decor smart and sophisticated without being OTT. The staff were very friendly and professional. The menu has lots of choices - starters, salads, pizza and pasta. We had a couple of pizzas, pasta carbonara and lasagne all of which were very tasty although nothing special. In terms of cost it’s quite punchy. The pizzas were $44 each and the pasta c$28 - all definitely on the high side vs. some of the other restaurants in Dempsey that are a lot cheaper. Overall a very nice meal with friends but the restaurant is nothing special, there are definitely better options up at Dempsey. Can’t say we shall be heading back in a hurry. ",3,,,,,,

We were seated indoors and, of course, it was not busy because of Covid restrictions. Service should have been excellent. However, service was atrocious. We practically had to beg for service. The waiter dropped off menus, never returned. Had to chase him down - for every single thing we ordered. Ordered wine, waiter never brought the bottle until I went outside to bar and searched for service to have it brought inside. Ordered food and it took 30 minutes to make tacos. LOL Worse, we ordered several items and they didn't arrive at all. I had to chase the Waiter for each item. It's as if the Waiter was a drone flying around without a CPU or a controller. Absolutely mindless and he acted like he didn't care at all. The cost for a low-end bottle of house wine, tacos, and a couple of deserts (had to wait 30 minutes for them to cut a piece of cold pecan pie and put it on a plate!) was almost $300. If just the service had been bad, then I might have dismissed the cost as 'life in Singapore', but at these prices alongside absolutely terrible service I'll never return. It is a waste of both time and money. There are much better experiences to be had elsewhere in Chijmes and the vicinity.",1,,,,,,

And it was ridiculously overpriced considering the quality of food was nothing great. The only good thing was the margaritas and nachos were not like the image they put on the menu. Considering this restaurant was quite expensive, the quality of food didn't meet my expectations at all. Also, they have merged with senor taco and the concepts of both the restaurants aren't the same (apart from they're both Mexican) so it seems a little mismatched and I didn't enjoy my dining experience? Portion sizes are very small compared to how much we pay and the same classiness of the restaurant is no longer there.

Each was absolutely delicious, well thought-out, and beautifully served. The portion sizes were just right: large enough to taste properly, but sufficiently small as to allow consumption of all nine without feeling - er, stuffed. The combinations were unique - to me, at least, e.g. a dish of forest mushrooms with matsutake, abalone and a mangalica pork ""veil"".

I'm not usually a fan of uber-fancy fine dining in restaurants where the dining area feels like a sanctum sanctorum. But Iggy's makes the cut in my book. It is sleek without being pretentious. It offers only set menus - pricey of course. We went for the smallest, a three-course meal (with amuses bouches to start and dainties with coffee to finish). The food was outstanding. Our starter was an arrangement of gazpacho-ish soup with scallops, mackerel, sea urchin and ever-so-slight slices of fresh kobe (or maybe kyoto) vegetables. It sounds larger than it was - the portion was perfect and it was a feast for eyes and palate. I had fish after that - can't remember the name but beautifully cooked with a crispy skin and again a delicate arrangement of veggies. Husband and daughter had drool-worthy wagyu beef. Portions were small and we didn't want to leave hungry so I asked if we could add on anything a la carte (not on the menu). The waiter suggested a small serving of cappellini with tiny prawns. Fabulous and, shared by three, a perfect portion each. Dessert was a work of art. Sometimes culinary works of art are all form and no substance. This one was both - an assemblage of a gold chocolate ball surrounded by beautiful bits and pieces - crystallised ginger, chocolate flakes coated in gold, hazelnuts, chocolate soil (i guess). and as the waiter poured caramel sauce onto the golden ball, it opened to reveal the pear sorbet inside. gimmicky some might say - i found it endearing. even more endearing - we should've been chocolated out by now - was the sweetest, both literally and figuratively, complimentary birthday treat i've ever had at a restaurant - a small chocolate egg, that i was told, earnestly, represented new life, and that i had to smash with a ribbon-bedecked large spoon. this too (like the gold ball) had a delight inside, coconut sorbet. iggy's is a delight and the lovely tina, our hostess, and the wait staff made it the more delightful. the room we dined in (the main room) does feel like a sanctum sanctorum - no windows, low lighting, situated at the end of a long corridor. i normally like windows in restaurants but the meal here was so good i forgot about the windowlessness of it.",5,,,,,,

Iggy's serve a fixed set menu (veggie, 5-course, 8-course similar to the 5 but you do not need to choose between options) that is regularly updated and you have the choice of changing some of the dishes if you have food restrictions. We went for the 5-course at $235+++ as the 8-course was a little too much for us. The food was good, interesting blend of flavors and creatively presented. There was a crispy potato shaped like a stone amongst a tray of real stones, served with truffle mayo. Wagyu beef with strips of white asparagus was quite delicious. Dessert was a dish of red berries scattered with bits of red cake and silver leaf flakes. We got a plate with a chocolate bar wishing us a happy anniversary which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and attentive. However, there was nothing to give it the extra edge. The meal was like what you'd get at any other fine-dining establishment.

Dishes were properly introduced and well paced. The ambient noise went up once the room filled up but within tolerable limits. Portions might not be big, but the number of dishes made up for it. We ordered a glass of rose wine which we thought went well with the mix of red and white meats. The Japanese touch to the meal was refreshing. A dessert wine to accompany the desserts would be recommended. Overall a nice culinary experience although the price is definitely on the high side ~S300 per person.

Iggy's,"581 Orchard Road Hilton International Singapore The Hilton Hotel, Singapore 238883 Singapore",tropicalnorth,42021,"Have hemmed and hawed about trying this expensive restaurant ""best in Singapore"" b/c of the poor reviews. It's a lot of money to put down to be hungry or disappointed, however my partner was keen on trying it so I made reservations that night for 2. It's located in the Hilton Hotel on Orchard which was undergoing renovations and also had a loud party with DJ going on the same level. However no noise could be heard inside the restaurant proper. There is a bar service room where people are seated at a bar but we were in another room further back. It's a sparse room with white tablecloths on tables and we were seated on leather parson-type chairs. There were the black plastic swivel chairs people complained about at other tables. Service was prompt, efficient without being suffocating. The room was manned by about 5 servers and they did an excellent job of keeping water/wine filled and cutlery available. They only serve a Gastronomie menu (veg or not) and so we ordered that and my partner had wine accompaniment. They don't do a formal wine pairing but instead charge you by the glass ($36) for the wines. The menu changes seasonally so I won't describe it in detail. They start you off with snacks and chips/bread sticks which I enjoyed. My partner didn't enjoy the curry fried anchovies as much as I did. I thought the snacks had interesting flavours and set a tone of what was to come. Three types of bread (with refill) were offered: peanut, cheese and almond. I found the almond dry and crusty (better with butter) and liked the cheese and peanut ones much more. We had a quail meatball cooked en papillote (plastic) with truffles which did not have much scent or flavour. My partner had the lamb and I had the wagyu beef which were good (I much preferred the Japanese wagyu to the Australian and it seemed a pity to serve both when the Japanese is so much better) They had a palate cleanser of gin/tonic and banana ice cream which I loved followed by an unlimited chocolate plate. I'm assuming they think you will be too full to demolish the tray but I managed to sample one of everything (for review purposes of course) The handmade chocolates were well done with the yuzu being a particular favourite. The jelly, marshmallow and chocolate truffle were pretty standard. Macarons (which Eric Ripert got me addicted to) were well crafted with a nice crust and soft innards however only 2 flavours really stood out: salted caramel (I think?) and black truffle. I have to admit the black truffle didn't immediately win me over, but the flavour profile was so true that I found myself warming up to it. This was the case with a few dishes we had. The toro/otoro was plated on cooked onions (I don't love onions) and initially ate it separately but gave it another try and ended up enjoying the combination more than toro separately. Of the wines, the chardonnay initially paired up well with the quail meatball bringing out the butteriness of the chardonnay but otherwise the wines were pretty standard - my partner wasn't enthused. They served champagne with the snacks and no dessert wine so 4 glasses total. Iggy was in the restaurant and spent a lot of time with a table of 4 beside us as well as 2 other tables in the room but didn't come by our table. I guess he's busy but it does seem like a snub to visit 3/5 tables. Bathroom is outside the restaurant and is typical for a mid-level hotel. Because of the party going on, it was a bit more awkward than for a usual night. There were 3 ladies hanging out when I visited. Coffee/tea is also not included in the price of the meal. Total cost for 2 people with only one drinking wine: $800. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. I'm not sure why there were poor reviews. Everything tasted fresh and was well cooked but the flavours were subtle. We were both quite full at the end of the meal. However there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about the meal which makes me want to return. If you're planning a special night out or want to impress guests, then this is a safe bet but in terms of being one of the best restaurants in the world - I don't think so.",4,,,,,,

The moment we sat down she then said to us to enjoy the foods. She informed us regarding the kind of foods they serve. She mentioned that if we need something we should not be hesitant to approach her. This statement she lamented truly drew affection and easiness with her. It is undeniably that there are very few staff that would treat us like that. In the midst of our meal my fork fell down.

They are only looking for your money and there seems to have been a change in manager/person who picks up the phone on calling their number.

However, when I ordered today, not only was the biryani cold, but it had DRY CHICKEN, as if boiled without seasonings (yuck). Adding insult to injury, the person on the phone told my family to add an extra item for $50 minimum charge with free delivery whereas last week the person was kind enough to do free shipping on $48.

Khansama is one of those places. The food is amazing, there is honestly nothing that can be faulted when it comes to the food. The service is also very good. The staff is incredibly attentive. The only thing that I would like to see a change in would be the furniture that they have...it is aesthetically fitting the theme of the restaurant, but it feels like it may just break apart! It feels dangerous and the furniture is incredibly heavy too. So it’s really difficult to push back the chair to get up and when you do manage to do that then there is the added fear that it will just break.

They also did a special lemon tea with no sugar which wasn’t on the menu. We enjoyed chicken biryani and egg biryani with a chick pea and spinach side dish. We asked about the size of the plain naan bread and were told to order just one and see how we go. We did end up ordering a second naan and it was light and crispy.

We decided on Khansama as we had read very good reviews of the restaurant, friendly staff and extremely tasty food!! The restaurant itself has an undercover eating area downstairs and an upstairs air conditioned dining area. The menu is extensive (perhaps too many options) with all the usual suspects you’d expect from an Indian restaurant. We ordered some onion bhajia and samosa to start, followed by Butter Chicken, Korma and Tikka Masala curries with plain rice, roti and naan. I must be missing something though. For me, the food was ordinary where the taste didn’t meet the expectation! The Korma sauce for example tasted more like “hot milk” whilst everything seemed to have a hint of being “smoked”!! The restaurant itself was also very dirty especially the tables whilst the toilets were disgusting - don’t go unless you absolutely have too! Yes the staff were friendly and yes, you could sit there and soak up the atmosphere but the restaurant and meal (for me) were a huge disappointment! There are plenty of other restaurants up and down the road - next time, we shall try one of them!! ",3,,,,,,

Someone was handing out flyers for this place near the temple so we thought we'd give it a try. It was about 5pm and not too busy. We had tandoori starters and a tikka main. The food was impressive, much more that I expected. I would highly recommend anyone in this area to come here for lunch or dinner. Staff are also very friendly.",5,,,,,,

We ordered the mixed Chats which were inedible, the tandoori chicken was so spicy we couldn’t eat it. We also ordered the dhal which was bland and tasteless. Not recommended. We paid $64 dollars and had only a few mouthfuls before we walked out. Wasted money. The naan bread was fine but that was the only up side. ",1,,,,,,

The menu was huge and impressive however the food was average. The pepper chicken had little depth of flavour - I think reflects the fact that it was added to a cooked sauce to enable delivering such a large selection of dishes. The service was not great and the waiters looked like they wanted to be anywhere else but there. Beware, the prices on the menu don't include taxes or service charges - this adds another 17%. Had much better food in the Tekka centre",3,,,,,,

Called the first time and was told by one of your staff that the food was on its way and I should give another 5-10mins. Waited another 20 mins to give the benefit of traffic, was told that my order did not exist! And claimed that my order was missed due to a second order request that came in shortly after mine. How convenient it is to blame the system. Humans invented the system, fault lies in humans so don’t blame your system when your staff overlooked.

Taking a stroll down the narrow streets and seeing all the 22cart gold makes one hungry!! So we decided on this place as it was 'traditional'. We ordered 2 soft drinks and proceeded to check out the menu, with a waiter hovering over us the whole time!!! These decisions can't be rushed!!!!Veg Pakora to start and some poppadom ....covered in tomato, onion and chilli when I clearly said no chilli, but hubby enjoyed and I shook the stuff off. Mains came, chicken tikka masala, (for Hubby)king prawn biryani, (for me)rice and 2 garlic naan bread. Nearly blew the head off my husband who loves hot spicey food!!!! Way toooooo hot for a masala dish!!! My prawns were hot too for my liking but I added the natural yogurt from the poppadom to mine and it was bearable. Unfortunately hubby's got the better of him and he had to give up!!! and I'm sure I asked for half servings, (which they advertised in their menu). So such a waste of money and at $99.80 Singapore dollars, it was a brave chunk of money. Also dont get me started on the toilet!!!! Unisex with a toilet bowl, a urinal and a shower hose!!! Floor was soaked, pubic hair and pee on the seat...(was desperate so hovered clutching tightly to my shorts!!) and the smell!!!!! I came out SCRUBBED my hands and made disgusting faces too hubby who refrained from using it!!! But they must have seen my horror as the mob and bucket came out and the smell of disinfectant would have knocked you out, but so much better than it was!! All in all not a great experience!",3,,,,,,

When i asked for a change in seats as it felt unreasonable to me when i clearly booked a reservation a week earlier for my friends 21st birthday, the manager's response was ""you all want you all go lo, i already explain to yall liao what"" in a very rude tone.

I went there with my friends and all of the staff greeted us with a smile. Then came a surprise cake for me with 2 sparkle sticks. There was a particular staff named Jon who was very attentive to our requests. Also, he would automatically change our jug of water if he sees it running low. Of all of the restaurants I’ve been to, we have to request it most of the time for a change but because of his attentiveness towards the customers, it saved us the trouble.

The cendol is indeed a perfect and cooling end to the meal, unfortunately despite it's higher price as compared to normal hawker offering, it does not have a single attap chee added to complete an otherwise excellent sweet ending!

Rice was really good with smell creamy of coconut. Chicken thigh was juicy. I liked their fish, it was crunchy and fun. I didn't order any drink just had ice water and I thought it was cool enough for lunch because it was hot outside, I asked for a little spicy sauce and ice water cooled down spicy food .

This place didnt' disappoint. The owners went to Malaysia and brought back recipes that had been passed down through generations of nonya families. The fact that they only serve nasi lemak shows that they have perfected their dish. Rich, full of flavour and delicious chicken paired with exquisitively spicy sambal and crunchy Ikan bilis and peanuts, topped off with a perfectly fried egg. Otak otak were equally tasty made with freshly caught fish! If you are craving a truly authentic Nasi Lemak outside of Malaysia, don't miss Coconut Club!",5,,,,,,

The food is pretty good but there is room for improvement in customer service orientation. I was a little disappointed during this visit - attention was to our food orders and requests were cursory. We were assured that the finger food would come first but it arrived after some of us were having our main course. We ordered dessert to share and although there were 7 of us, only 4 plates were given to us and we had to help ourselves to extra plates in the end. We finished our meals and were waiting for coffee and desserts but no-one took the initiative to clear the table until we asked a couple of times. And this was not for lack of staff. There were even some resting in the lounge area outside the cafe. This is a club to cater to military officers and this slackening of good service (relative to when they first opened) is not healthy.

However my last visit there was disappointing. After waiting for more than half an hour for my order of Morrocan Chicken to be served and the majority of my colleagues (there were 12 of us) has gotten their order and almost finishing their meal, I was presented with a charcoal black chicken. Shocked, I ask the waiter if this dish is meant to be this way, he agreed that it was ""bit burnt"" and took it back to the kitchen. Another staff then came over to advise that I need to wait another 15 mins or so for my order to be cooked and any other western meal will be the same - at least 15 min waiting time!!! If I order Chinese, it is faster. So I have no choice - as I cannot make the rest of my colleagues wait for me, I had chosen the Penang Char Kway Teow and it was awful. It was a bit too sweet for my liking and the colour (which comes from the dark sauce) is not the Penang kway teow that I am accustomed to. Hence it is an understatement to say I did not enjoy the food that lunch. ",2,,,,,,

Senor Taco Clarke Quay,"3 D River Valley Road #01-12 Clarke Quay, Singapore 179023 Singapore",AndyCworld,43897,"Bottom line- Margaritas were watered-down and way overpriced...bordering on ripoff. Going rate in Singapore is $15-19 for margaritas of slightly varying sizes. These are $16.9 (.9? Really?). We started with frozen margaritas and couldn’t tell if they mistakenly left out the alcohol completely. For the next round we tried “on the rocks”. It was all ice with a little margarita, which completely diluted when, shockingly, the ice melted sitting outside in the Singapore heat. Final round we asked for less ice, and got what amounted to a shot of margarita (see for yourself how it came to the table in the attached pic). Would you pay $16.9 for that? Very disappointing, but we should have known after seeing reviews indicating waitresses are giving free drinks for customers to write reviews. Any restaurant that engages in free stuff for reviews obviously needs to do that for some reason. The food was good so that raised it from one star.

Senor Taco Clarke Quay,"3 D River Valley Road #01-12 Clarke Quay, Singapore 179023 Singapore",TravelDiaries_Pulkit,43801,I heard good reviews about the place but was disappointed with my time here. They have so little space and they prefer having salsa classes during evenings which means lesser space. I sat inside and liked the music and dance classes though the food and drinks was a let down. The beer was bad and the taco could have been better - I might give it one more try but would prefer sitting out and ordering a hard tortilla taco.,3,,,,,,

Senor Taco Clarke Quay,"3 D River Valley Road #01-12 Clarke Quay, Singapore 179023 Singapore",Michelle W,43637,"The nachos were awful - cheese that came out of a can, the minced beef was sloppy and had no flavour which then made the nacho chips very soggy and unpleasant to eat. Same with hubby's taco - the beef was generous but tasteless and there was nothing else on the taco (where's the rest of the filling??) I've eaten Mexican in Adelaide and it's flavoursome and you can taste the spices and lime - the food from Senor Taco was nothing like that at all. Another downside - Clarke Quay is a smoke-free zone yet patrons were coming out of the bar area and smoking near diners. When we questioned this with the waitress, she said that its up to the police to fine them. I disagree - you need to ensure your patrons adhere to local laws which are in place for a reason.

Senor Taco Clarke Quay,"3 D River Valley Road #01-12 Clarke Quay, Singapore 179023 Singapore",sgngchris,43455,"Dishonest + Exorbitant Charges for Water1. DISHONEST - They have raised their prices for their food items but continue to give customers the old menu with the old pricing. We caught them out on this but only after we have paid and they were unwilling to give a refund. Suggested nicely to them that they should get rid of the old menu with the old pricing as it's not representative of their actual pricing but their response did not indicate that they were going to do so.2. EXORBITANT WATER CHARGES - They do not serve drinking water here. Cost is $5 for a small bottle of water. I had lunch at Prego (a proper restaurant in Fairmont Hotel) earlier and they charged $3 for free flow sparkling water. If you go to Wine RVLT @ Carpenter Street, they offer you free free flow sparkling or still water - That's what good customer service is about. Stop profiteering from your customers for something like water that costs next to nothing in Singapore.3. DO NOT get Chope vouchers for Senor Taco - We made a mistake of buying the vouchers from the Chope App and found out that if you are using the Chope App, you are not allowed to enjoy any of the Happy Hour drinks. This was not stated in the terms and conditions.

No Menu,"23 Boon Tat Street, Singapore 069621 Singapore",Frank Y,"December 2, 2019","Friday night at No Menu, dinner for 4. The Burrata was the highlight and best I have had The main course duck was dry with a few steamed vegetables. A simple, small dish that I have had better in many establishments at near half the price. Pasta dishes were good but not particularly special and the most expensive pasta I have seen. Similar dishes on the cruise ship we arrived on were definitely better. Other items were good but not better than can be easily found elsewhere, again at half the price. We were seated downstairs in the main restaurant. I am not sure why that would be preferred. It was crowded and so noisy that conversation was near impossible. Service was friendly and quite prompt. So in summary I just cannot find it in me to give more than 3 stars for a fairly average Italian meal with prices the highest I have seen anywhere for similar fare.

We were immediately ushered to the front room upstairs. Of the other four tables, three of them were families with children. Having children myself, I normally don't mind being in restaurants with well behaved kids. However, in this situation it felt like we were misfits who were conveniently put in the ""family"" room. We would have appreciated being seated in the back room upstairs room or downstairs where there we no kids. Instead of requesting to be moved, I assumed we would have a great dining experience which would erase any bad feelings about the seating situation. Unfortunately the server was not very friendly and seemed to rush us. Besides our server none of the other staff or owners came to our dining room, another reason we felt ignored. Food was fine, not as good as we remembered. We ate our meal and went somewhere else for drinks and dessert . We were out of there in less than an hour.

No Menu,"23 Boon Tat Street, Singapore 069621 Singapore",Marlene W,"February 2, 2018","No Menu is a rarity in Asia: proper Italian ingredients with an Italian chef and family to cook, serve and most importantly, welcome. One could tell immediately that the Roma tomatoes were not the pale soggy Asian-grown tomato substitutes used in most of Asia's so-called Italian restaurants. These tasted like tomatoes and like Italy. The burrata was heavenly, likewise the prosciutto. We sampled the cannelloni, the insalata mista, and my perennial favourite, linguine vongole, a dish usually mis-managed in most Asian restaurants. No Menu's proper execution included the white clam sauce derived from the simple act of heating the unopened clams in a savoury garlic, white wine and parsley broth. No inundations of tinned clam sauce or lashings of, heaven forbid, cream as an ill thought rendering of ""white"" sauce. The bread at the table was always topped up throughout the meal, and was brilliant - the few leftovers there were came home with me and the bread and burrata was gorgeous next day. The only drawback is the noise level in the restaurant - being popular, it was full and being in Asia, was noisy. Nothing to do about that - the food more than compensates.",5,,,,,,

The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste. The highlight for me was antipasti, several type of pastas, and the grill beef rib eye all were outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while , the price tag is on the high side but what the hack if the food and wine is outstanding . About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive.

However my last visit yesterday, changed my opinion of the place. We waited for 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive and 1 hour for our food to arrive. This despite having a booking at the restaurant. Staff is all over the place and seem overwhelmed with the busy and number of orders. Isn't there a system in place? You take the order. Punch it in to the computer, and it tells kitchen and barristers what to do. As a result of being over whelmed, they seem arrogant and reply to order enquiries in a rude manner. ""We are busy. Maybe a 30-45 minutes wait."" (This after 45 minutes of waiting). We even had our 17 month old toddler with us, and even then kids meal came last. Over the years, their standard has dropped.

It's my third time trying the wings, and it has been consistently delicious. The other two dishes we had, Truffle Mushroom Linguine and Pulled Pork were okay. Not too bad, could do with more truffle on the first dish and though I loved the taste for pulled pork, wasn't a fan of its texture. The chicken wings still set the best standard. I had the tarts before, they were delicious. The sponge cakes (we had Earl Grey Banana and Salted Caramel Popcorn) however, were disappointed. Really dry sponges. Only the middle part of the cake was moist. Probably left out in the open for too long and dried up.Another thumbs down was the service staff. We were served by this tall guy with spectacles who came to take our order. I wanted to ask about the dish, and I guess because it was really noisy around, he couldn't hear it the first time. Instead of politely asking me to repeat, he raised his voice and went ""HUH??? WHAT??"" It was very so rude. I think he noticed the look on my face that I was unhappy. It's really disappointing.

I expected as much when it comes to fine dining that serving would be small but didn’t expect it to be that small given it’s my first visit. I’ve been to other Italian places and personally I’d say good quality wise you can get same level for lesser price. Be careful with the meat order as it has a minimum weight order but it’s was honestly quite good. Overall I would come back maybe more for drinks and the view but certainly not the food.

I made arrangements for our party of 3 to celebrate a birthday. Looking at a copy of the Chef's Menu online, the offspring agreed that it was the kind of food we would enjoy. The execution of the menu exceeded the simple descriptions. From the well made amuse bouche right to the final course of 3 delectable petit fours (sorbet infused strawberry!), we enjoyed every bite. In these lockdown times, it evoked for us memories of our last trip to Italy, 2 years ago. The Chef’s Menu offered tastes of fresh prawn, an autumnal fish, pasta cooked simply with sweet crab meat, culminating in top grade Miyazaki wagyu strip loin, cooked perfectly. The “forest” inspired dessert was an outstanding execution of contrasting textures - the crunch a wafer, the bite of top quality chocolate, a smooth mousse. Each plate was beautifully presented and explained clearly, though unobtrusively. Most importantly, it was food you actually enjoyed eating. What sealed the evening was the outstanding service.

I mean food was OK so never thought of coming back especially it is located at CBD area. Since CoVid, we like to have a nice dinner once a week and partner says Zafferano, I said ok go book then. He went online and disappointed they need pre-payment before you can have a table. I know resto are hard hit these days and with CoVid measures, less tables and less revenue. But to ask for pre-payment doesn't sit well with many customers. So we said NO! We won't go then. Friday came and suddenly we thought lets ring Zafferano, if they're not fully booked, we walked in! We did and I was impresse ",5,,,,,,

From the moment we stepped in, the view was amazing & service was top notch. I work in the service industry myself so I place service standards above all. Our server, PK (also known as Kumar) was very forthcoming & engaging. He took the time to explain the dishes & wines and we had a lovely conversation with him. The dishes he recommended were to our liking as well! At the end of the meal, my boyfriend was surprised with a birthday dessert as well. I was very amazed because PK and the rest of the staff remembered my requests & my wine choice for the night as well. Also, they made sure to check on us throughout our dinner. Overall, Zafferano is a perfect place for one to bring their dinner date to because of their great views overlooking Singapore city and for their impeccable service as well. To the managers / front of house /servers & chefs in the kitchen, a great job done to making our night a terrific one. Thank you for the excellent job well done!

The food quality is fine and the menu is interesting. But the service is funny for a pricy place. Super kind waiters but they have no idea of the order of the food in a real Italian restaurant.

I went in with very high expectations and while the location is fantastic, I expected more from a culinary perspective. Perhaps things would have been different if I wasn't in a large group and could have ordered off the menu, but my experience is what it was.",3,,,,,,

Whether you are looking for a nice brunch with the family or an exuberant night with your friends, this place is the epitome of both. Just when you think it cannot get any better, the music enhances the overall atmosphere of the venue, only making you wish that the night was still young.

The bar staff were friendly, quick and responsive to my guests needs, really above what I have seen at other venues.

Zafferano Italian Restaurant & Lounge,"10 Collyer Quay Ocean Financial Centre Level 43, Singapore 049315 Singapore",DavidWeeisme,"October 26, 2018","Came here for birthday celebration. Atmosphere is great with quality food and affordable value (Considering this as Fine-dining concept). Some of the service staffs that attended to us are friendly and attentive. I could have given 5 stars rating for everything but one thing that disappointed me was a private event that wasn't notified to me beforehand during the table reservation. Don't get me wrong that this should be an obligation on their side, the main issue wasn't about the private event but rather on how one of their guy staffs handled the situation.The private event occupied their entire outdoor lounge and since this is our first time visiting this place, one main attraction would be their sky lounge (do note that the only area that you see the full city view is at their lounge and not within the restaurant itself). As a form of courtesy, I requested for a small favour from a lady staff and it was a ‘green light’ given that we could visit the lounge for a short while to take few photos of the beautiful city view (under the escort of the lady staff). So, what happened next is while we are taking photos at the lounge, one guy staff came over and called us to leave immediately. I’m ok with that because after all is a private event that they paid a lot for it, but his engagement is quite rude and react as if we are like tourists looking for free stuffs. My bill might not be huge but is a reminder that I’m also a paying customer here, if you feel that customers should pay more to receive a better treatment, then I advise you stating a minimum spending amount. If today my main purpose was to visit your sky lounge and I wasn’t aware that the lounge was closed, am I right to receive a 50% discount since it didn’t fulfil my objective? This is definitely unfair to the business right.. so what I just hope to see is some empathy shown to us when disappointment happened, NOT come straight to our face and said ‘Please Leave Now’. Might still come again in future but there are few other choices of the similar concept out there, so not necessary to make this as your permanent hangout place ",4,,,,,,

Quality and taste of the food was very inequal. My starter, described as ""Salmon carpaccio"" appeared to be just smoked salmon on a frisee salad quite bitter in taste (supplement 8 SGD), very bad choice. Then, Beef ragout pasta was good but portion tiny as a main dish. Finally I opted for the almond cake with mascarpone mouss and chocolate sauce. It was not a cake but a very hard biscuit which took me some enery to break in my plate, chocolate sauce was almost unexistant. I found very unequal the quality of food served. Plus they are doing some work on the terrace and instead of a nice view you can see the guys working with their ladder, not nice to pay that price for that food and view.",3,,,,,,

We also loved the Khorest-E- Bhamieh which is like an okra curry that is flavourful with plenty of ground tomatoes forming the foundation of the mildly spicy gravy. We also ordered the all-vege Sabzi Kebab and Ceaser Persia salad, both of which were not memorable taste-wise but came in big portions. The baklava was tasty and one order has two pieces; we all gave it a thumbs up. Interestingly this is a halal restaurant that also serves alcohol and they do pour their wine generously, which is great. Service was decent - you can get the attention of wait-staff easily and they are quite obliging.",4,,,,,,

Not only was there a perceptable deterioration in the quality of food - being creatures of habit we usually order dishes we've tried and liked before - but the service was borderline indifferent. It was almost as if the restaurant is in cost management mode and is hiring below average wait staff and chefs. For a fairly expensive meal we left a considerable amount of food uneaten as it was either wanting taste or plain unpalatable. For example this was the first time the rice had little or no butter in it. The browned Tahdig bits were soggy, the kebab portions were smaller, and the chicken dish was sweeter than dessert - which was delivered at the fag end of the meal and for which the chef offered an implausible explanation. They did however replace this dish with another lamb dish which was passab ",2,,,,,,

There were lots of local and Japanese cuisine as well and I say it’s value for money inspite of this festive period where hotels usually raise their price,5,,,,,,

Positano @ RP,"49 Circular Road, Singapore 049404 Singapore",iancM8834VC,"December 19, 2020","We stumbled upon this little gem of a restaurant by accident. To be honest, we were a little hesitant at first as the facade of the restaurant looked a little underwhelming. But as the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the pudding exceeded our expectations. We ordered the eggplant parmigiana, beef ragu fettuccine and the short ribs to share. Every single dish was delicious. Personally, my favorite was the short ribs - the beef were perfectly cooked, and the meat just fell off the bones. The excellent food was also matched by the warm and friendly service. The restaurant owner even took the time to come up to our table to have a chat even though it was clearly a busy evening for the restaurant. I am a bit ambivalent about “adding publicity” for this restaurant as the selfish part of me wishes it would be hidden. But credit should be given where it’s due.",5,,,,,,

Would have been 5 stars if the lobster we ordered is not slightly overcooked. Ah, perfection and consistency, and, balance, the bane of cooks. Balance was great. The lobster bisque sauce is to die for, noodle al dente, prawns fresh and crunchy and springy, the scallops, tender and juicy, the mussels, ok but alas the main attraction, the lobster slightly overcooked. Overall it is still a great dish. Could have been greater. Truffle mushroom soup was awesome except for the bread, somehow it taste off to me. But these are little tweaks that can be corrected.

It was barely busy during lunch hour which was a bit of a concern, and the ladies... well, I felt sorry for them. They didn’t seemed pleased to be there. As for the food, it’s really standard bar food fare. They served the main dishes before the appetizers and with a group of seven, we received our meals over a 20 minute period. Then, when we said let’s just make the most of it, one of my colleagues bites into a piece of plastic in her taco. We were told it was the top of one of the condiment bottles. Well, they apologized but not all that much and it took several attempts to get some sort of compensation on the bill. I don’t want to be mean but something was just wrong here with the management, the staff, the food. With all the options in this part of town , I really don’t know why anyone would want to go there.

Wrong! It was quite small (maybe 200grams) and advertised as rib eye but looked more like sirloin and my medium-rare was cooked medium-well which made it as chewy as an old boot! The waitress didn't even ask why I only ate a third of my meal so maybe she's used to seeing that happen. Maybe I was expecting too much after all the brand is renown for its buffalo wings not steaks. But my wife ordered the mixed grill which wasn't much better. The prawns were OK but you can't trick her when it comes to marinating and cooking on a bbq. The chicken thigh wasn't a slow cooked job, it had been boiled in the marinade and then just finished on a grill to get the bbq look. Least that's our opinion without checking the kitchen.

We ordered buffalo chicken wings and beers. The drinks arrived 30 minutes from the time we arrived and the wings another 15 minutes later. When the wings did arrive, after eating 2 of them I noticed that they weren't cooked (photos attached). I had literally eaten raw bloody chicken and didn't notice because it was disguised by the sauce. I gave them the benefit of doubt, deciding it must have been a one off, then my husband found that his wings were also bloody and uncooked. We promptly left our unfinished food and drinks, complained to the manager who subsequently brought us our bill for the drinks. Now you don't visit Hooters for the service but it is not unreasonable to expect for our bill to be cleared (we had only eaten 3 of 20 wings and had not finished our drinks) This did not happen and neither did we receive an apology. What kind of person does not even apologise? I tell you who, so called manager Emma who not only didn't apologise, but had a stinking attitude.

This franchise is so cheap it's embarrassing. Curly fries are $5.90. Curly fries with cheese is $6.90. That's a $1 difference. When you ask for a top-up of cheese sauce, they charge you $2.30... completely irrational, moronic and greedy. The measly amount they give you will only last you half of the fries. You could get away with a $1 top up even though that's still ridiculous. It would make more sense to STATE ON THE MENU the cheese sauce top-ups are $1 and then give it to the customers for free as it would not cost the establishment a dime in the long run, so that you would secure guaranteed revisits and positive word of mouth. This isn't about cheese sauce, it's about management and morale. This place even forces you to buy bottled water even though Singapore has drinkable tap water. The food is average. The waitresses are friendly but the service feels inconsistent. It's clear this franchise survives only on the Hooters brand name and the location.

However the dinning experience wasn't so nice as we were told there was a 90mins dinning time. The way of staff explanation was saying they had to serve 2 rounds dinning which like we would be chased out. This 90mins dinning hours is ridiculous especially when you have a big group of friends and birthday celebration is going on. This is something needed to be looked into. Wouldn't be ridiculous to have a this rule in a bar? ",3,,,,,,

But we were surprised that every single dish we ordered was really good! Very nice sashimi, but other highlights for me included bifu yakiniku, hotate mentaiyaki, tamago, smoked duck and chilled buckwheat noodle. And the new dish, sliced grilled wagyu beef, was so good that we had a number of reorders. And the service was excellent - friendly and fast. My food came practically within 3 minutes after ordering. Amazing. We came away feeling great, which is how all good dining experiences should be. My family is looking forward to our next visit to Mitsuba again! ",5,,,,,,

Gayatri Restaurant,"122 Race Course Road, #01-01, Singapore 218583 Singapore",MVRabin,"October 18, 2020","I write to convey my experience and unhappiness for my deliveroo order made on Saturday, 17th October for dinner about 7pm. I had just been discharged from hospital and we had decided to order in Gayatri's since I wasn't feeling too good to visit the outlet. Therefore ,my family and I, 4 of us had ordered to have a feast at home instead. Although there are tonnes of options for South Indian cuisine listed everywhere on Deliveroo,Food Fanda and Grab Food, with relatively affordable pricing, we still stuck with our decision to order from you'll as its one of our fav restaurants to frequent. But the experience we encountered via our delivery definately made us reconsider this decision. Firstly, we ordered all the dishes we liked but couldn't find White/Basmati Rice. I scrolled top and bottom but only could find Rice Set that comes with 2 vegetables. But that wasn't what we wanted. As an Indian Restaurant, and rice being a staple, we were puzzled on how there would be no rice in the menu. Nevertheless, still being keen to place the order we called your race course outlet directly informing of this dilemma. A lady had answered (I don't have her name as she was adamant on not providing it) and told me should we like to place an order for rice, we could choose the option for Papadam instead and they will replace it accordingly. So anyone in the right state of mind would assume, should I want 4 packets of rice I should choose 4 packets papadam and they would edit the order accordingly as spoken. And that's exactly what we did, placed an order for 3 packets of papadam at $1.95 each and called the lady to alert her of this special arrangement. We even mentioned please give us 1 papadam and 2 rice as the amendment for 3 packets papadam as previously discussed. This was confirmed and we prepared to enjoy our dinner to celebrate my disharge. Although it was a true hassle firstly to get the rice sorted, we didn't want it to get to us so we can get the food we like. Annnd the food arrives, with an overload of papadam and 1 packet of rice. Here we are hungry and excited to eat but there's only 1 packet of rice for 4 people. A little ridiculous considering all the effort put in to explain the order to the rude lady whom answered. I therefore call and try to find out why there is only one rice and the same lady says she could only give us 1 packet rice because it is $4.50 for each packet and our previous discussion with her to amend our 3x papadam couldn't cut it because $1.95x3=$5.85 would only entitle us one rice and papadam.Seriously?! we had ordered a variety of dishes amounting to about $60 and you could have added a packet of rice out of goodwill or even explained this to us when we called for the amendments. How were we to know the rice charges if it weren't even in the menu?When we called to ask the lady rudely passed the phone to a man I assume is the manager called Maniam whom also wasn't sorry at all about what had happened. He kept insisting we can only give what was paid for but how are we to pay for something that is not even on the menu or we know the price for?If we can order all the variety dishes, you think we can't order another packet of rice? Already I was not feeling too well and all we wanted was a good family dinner but no, it was ruined. We didn't have rice or even the fish gravy we requested for. We put in a special comment to request for fish gravy because we do not want the fish curry with fish since we already had fish varuval and fish cultlet, just the gravy would have been all we needed.But no, Maniam said tit needed to be ordered they don't even give complimentary fish gravy.How do I order if it doesnt exist in your menu?And considering we've been there to eat umpteen times I'm honestly appalled by this. I mean if i did a small order and you couldn't give me some gravy I may understand, but I did quite a substantial order but you can't provide some gravy?And to make it worse, we even heard the manager Maniam telling the lady on the phone, why didn't you just tell them we ran out of gravy thinking we couldn't hear and understand. It was so disappointing, and honestly a huge dampening of spirits for the family dinner we had looked forward to. I mean we had only asked for amendments for items not found in your menu and unimaginably rice not found for an Indian restaurant is absurd!And having to charge for a little gravy (non-existent in the menu as well) for a substatial order is penny wise, pound foolish. It has been time consuming to type this out to you but I would like to convey the bad and unexceptional service provided. As you are aware there are several restaurants available in the stretch of Race Course, please do not be over confident and lose long term customers for foolish reasonings. Keen to hear your reasoning.",2,,,,,,

Tried a mutton dosa, a butter naan, butter chicken, pepper prawns and mutton mysore as a sharing platter between two. Each dish was better than the last but hard to pick the nicest, for me it was the mysore, for my companion it was the butter chicken but no morsel of anything was left uneaten. The staff were pro-active and helpful, altogether a superb experience and we will definitely go back for more. Great place, fantastic food.",5,,,,,,

Place looks pretty good but for some unknown reason they dimmed the lights in the main dining room halfway through the meal. Staff members who took our orders were impatient and unhelpful. They rattled on with the options without any pauses or checks to see if we understood what they were saying. When we asked for opinions on portion size for our party (eg. if we should order M or L portions, or if they reckon we’ve ordered too much etc.), the lady gave me an answer to which she might as well have shut up. She answered “it depends (on each individual)”. I have never been to a Chinese restaurant and be spoken to like this. Most restaurants would give suggestion and inform you that you may order more later if you deem the food are insufficient for your party. More over her eyes were roaming, she was unfocused, and didn’t offer to give any suggestions whatsoever (I’d appreciate even if she was upselling). Food was not special, pretty average. Could easily get the same quality at any other Chinese restaurant. We asked for chillies and soya sauce and the China Chinese lady asked for exactly how many portions we require, and gave us measly portions. When we needed more (this is Singapore, everything we eat goes with chilli), she pointed out there are some left on our lazy Susan. WHAT!?? Would I not know how much chilli I need or are the chilli from your personal stash that’s why you’re reluctant to give me more!?!! Did I mention they forgot to key in one of the dishes into the system so we waited and waited but it never came. When we asked, she said she forgot to key in and DID NOT EVEN APOLOGISE. End of meal, we got them to serve our cake. They cut it ruining every piece served. I should have taken some photos. Every time we tried to get some service, we were ignored. Being busy doesn’t mean you can ignore your guests. An acknowledgment and informing me to wait a moment would be much appreciated. Didn’t happen. But we noticed the table beside us had a dedicated server throughout their dinner as though someone was on standby for them throughout. Maybe it was a regular customer but aren’t we all paying the same price and we could have become a regular customer as well, no? Anyhow, you lost my vote. Whole experience was ruined by the crap service, seeing how we were excited to try this place. Never coming back here. And urge all not to.",1,,,,,,

When we entered there we were ushered in politely and the manager at the front desk asked us what we wanted. We duly showed him our coupons and told him that we would like to redeem the Chicken Biryanis. The minute we said that, the manager's tone changed and he became extremely hostile. He rudely told us that he cannot permit us to use the coupons as they can be used as one coupon per table. We agreed to that and one of us ate first, while the rest of us went shopping to return later. We returned later and once again the manager in a rude, loud voice (now practically yelling at us) told us that we will have to sit separately. Again we agreed to it (it was just two of us at this point). Then the manager suddenly changed his statement and started humiliating us very loudly.

I really like this place because it's so kid-friendly. The wait staff is tolerant and very accommodating. The prices are very reasonable. We've tried some other menu items and haven't been bowled over - pizza is clearly their forte. I do look forward to trying their salads though. They also offer take-away for those with a car.

Prices are quite standardized, but I like the fact that their products are not overly sweet like the usual Americans' sweet. It is a healthier choice, no doubt.",4,,,,,,

Service wasn't that efficient though with the surprisingly huge crowd on a Monday afternoon. Apparently there's no service charge here and orders are done manually at the counter, much to my surprise for this seemingly high-class restaurant. Nevertheless, I am glad this was the case as it would help me to save up on the extra expenses :P I ordered the black truffle mushroom risotto and gnocchi endamame hazelnut pesto pasta, both of which were satisfying, fulfilling and enjoyable. I personally prefer the mushroom risotto that comes with a light, creamy sauce and generous amount of mushrooms, a chewy and juicy mouthfeel with a pleasant earthy note. The truffle flavour was distinct and aromatic as well. On the other hand, the gnocchi comes with a pesto sauce that was creamy, thick and flavourful but a tad heavy and oily on the palate. The gnocchi was chewy and mochi-like, served with endamame beans and a little melted mozzarella cheese that was thick and gooey. We also tried the waffle and triple scoop gelato for desserts. Feel free to sample the gelato prior to your order, which I did and the samples were given in a generous amount too! The gelato flavours that I had were: salted butter caramel (my favourite), yogurt and dark chocolate on a belgian waffle served with butterscotch sauce. Texture of the gelato was smooth, creamy and melt-in-the mouth kind that I adore. Really love the gelato here though the waffles were just a run-off-the-mill, lacking crispness and fragrance in the batter. ",4,,,,,,

We ordered Polpo’ , Balsamic Grilled Octopus Tentacles for Appetizer and it was so tender , soft and delicious. I tried the same dish in other Italian restaurant , most other restaurants will get the tip of the tentacle char and burnt but not in Bulamacco, they cook it nicely without buringing the tip which is a plus for me. This is by far the best Polpo I had tried in Singapore. We also order the Linguine’ Boston Lobster Tail and I have to comment that the lobster was so fresh and nicely cooked. The cook did it nicely so that it was not over cook and become very chewy. We really love the dish. The portion is big as they served the whole lobster and is really worth if for the price we paid. My daughter had the ‘Capellini’ Angel Hair with Blue Swimmer Crab Meat and it was another very tasty and delicious dish. I had ‘Tonnarelli’ Pasta with Hokkaido Scallops in Basil ‘Pesto’.

Burlamacco Ristorante,"30 Stanley Street, Singapore 068739 Singapore",BensNose,"October 7, 2019","Italian in Singapore? We previously had a bad experience with an “up-scale” and “posh” Italian restaurant here and we were skeptical. Well, Singaporeans you have an undiscovered jewel in the Italian crown. An excellent restaurant is the combination of good service staff and an excellent chef and kitchen brigade. We spent many summers In Forte dei Marmi and enjoyed the sophisticated Italian cuisine of Tuscany. Gabriele Piegaia cooks with the finesse of his hometown of Lucca (Tuscany) in Singapore using local products. We ordered the Cozze (Pot-Cooked Black Mussels in White Wine & Tomato ‘Guazzetto’) and Battuta (Hand Chopped Raw Red Tuna Tartar Served with Avocado) for starters. The dishes were excellent. The main dish was a Filetto (Grilled Beef Tenderloin with Kenia Beans & Mashed Potato) with and without foie-gras ‘alla Rossini’. I ordered the dish without the mashed potato but with Truffle Fries (extra side order). My wife is a nightmare for the kitchen brigade, since she orders the filetto medium-to-well. This is the best test for the professionalism of the kitchen brigade, and the quality of the product. Zero failure, and excellent texture and taste. The meal was accompanied by a Brunello di Montalcino. The diner companions confirmed their previous good experience whilst ordering Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Beef Tenderloin with Parmesan Cheese) and the Cozze, and as main dishes Cacciucco (Traditional Tuscan Fish & Seafood Stew with Garlic Bruschetta) and again the Filetto alla Rossini. The waiting staff decanted the two bottles of Brunello and it was another pleasant surprise. The glasses were the right size and format (important!) for a Riserva wine in order to taste the full bouquet with all your senses. The meal was finalized with a heavenly Tortino (Ginger Date Pudding with Toffee Sauce & Vanilla Ice Cream) and a lemon sorbet. We skipped the coffee and decided for a digestive of an excellent grappa. All in all a pleasant experience to get rid of the jetlag. I am a regular contributor to TripAdvisor and I have only given once 5 stars to Frans Wiget with his 18 Gault Millot restaurant Adelboden, Schwyz (Switzerland). Gabriel Piegaia and “Burlamacco Ristorante” is not ranked by Gault Millot or Michelin, but he deserves an incentive and support for the excellence of his cuisine and his staff. The only criticism would be the basic presentation of the dishes. There could be more finesse, decorative and abstract, emphasizing the ingredients. The essence is the taste and preparation, and that is excellent as it should be prepared in Tuscany. I therefore don’t understand his current ranking by TripAdvisor. Sure, it is not the posh environment for a star restaurant but give the talent of this chef, it deserves a top ranking. Sha ",5,,,,,,

Everyone went home completely full and satisfied. As it was a Tuesday evening, we were able to get good service and food. ",5,,,,,,

BURLAMACCO has always offered interesting dishes hardly seen elsewhere. Their tripe appetizer has been my favourite although it disappeared from the menu in the last 6 months. (I was happily informed that it would be making a comeback!) This time the menu offered a spinach cream pasta which is again a rare sight. It was very nice and a good deviation from the run of the mill pasta sauces. The Sicilian red wine on offer at $48++ was actually quite good and I would recommend it. I have been to BURLAMACCO many times, even before it moved to its current location, and its dishes have rarely disappointed. ",4,,,,,,

Burlamacco Ristorante,"30 Stanley Street, Singapore 068739 Singapore",Dylan L,"June 17, 2018","I’ve been to Burlamacco on a couple of occasions before, and never have I had service as revolting as that which I’d received today. From the outset, our waiter was condescending in his tone, emphasising (and I quote), that he has ‘a very full restaurant’, and that he ‘has a kitchen to run’, when all we wanted to do was to order some sides to share, ON TOP of the main courses that we have already chosen. I’d understand his outburst if we didn’t want to order mains, or shared a main between two people - but that was not the case. Everyone had their own main course and yet we received such scorn and disdain for no good reason. Unfortunately, the manager was no better. She was cold and unfriendly, and worse, did not even have the decency to replace used cutlery with new ones, but instead asked that I reused cutlery from my previous course for the next. That would all be well and good, had the waiter not boasted: ‘we are not a bistro, we are a Michelin-style restaurant’. Indeed, the kitchen is top-notch. One would be hard-pressed to find good, hearty Italian food at this price range in Singapore. The food was impeccably cooked, served piping hot, bursting with flavours. However, any meal at a restaurant of this alleged, self-proclaimed calibre should know that a dining experience is made up as much of food quality as it is service standards. The greatest pity is that the latter has completely failed the former. What an absolute disappointment. I will never be returning to Burlamacco again.",2,,,,,,

Duck and fish was also semi cold and average tasting. It was 9pm and we were starving so we just nibbled on the mains and left. Service was average. We were choosing between the Merlot and Pinot Noir and the staff said we could order the Pinot if we like drinking water??? Whattt!!! Such a strange comment. Perhaps he was trying to crack a joke?

There wasn't a signboard that asked customers to 'Please wait to be seated'. If there was, we would have waited there. There wasn't. So my daughter walked up to the guy who was at the cashier and requested a table for 3. This guy's response was something like 'Can't you see I am busy? Can't you wait?' & it was a talk down kind of tone...My daughter just turned 26 n we were there to celebrate her birthday. She was wearing a hoodie and probably cos of that this guy thought she was still a teenager and didn't respect her as a customer. (Still, one should treat all equally). I was right behind my daughter and I heard him. I was appalled n disgusted and felt that this kind of attitude was uncalled for. He might be busy but he could have been more polite. My daughter expressed her displeasure to the guy that she didn't appreciate this kind of treatment. He didn't even stop for one second to address this concern. He just said ' Sorry but I was busy with the bills' as he walked away. Same kind of tone and attitude. No sincerity felt in his 'sorry'...We left without eating and went to look for another place to dine. So what if the food was good? The service sucks despite a waitress coming up and trying to pacify us. That one star is for her. Thanks but no thanks! We won't visit here again.

I actually had a bad morning and so I just had to have my comfort food - beef steak! The staff were very friendly and for a start, the bread served was simply delicious! I ordered the ribeye and it was really good! Well-marbled and succulent, it was cooked just right! I also enjoyed the decadent dessert (think it's called ""Chocolate Thunder"", a pecan brownie with rich vanilla ice cream sitting on warm chocolate sauce). Considering it was lunch hour, the place wasn't very crowded though. I was seated at a table with a view of Peranakan Place but it also meant it took some time for the staff to notice that I was ready to foot the bill.

We started with the duck skin roll professionally carved at the table with cucumber and sauce perhaps a little more garnish would have been nice to compliment the duck. For main we asked amongst 3 or 4 chose the Sichuan style which was nice and tasty but with too much chili added (and I love spicy food) but the dried fry chili were over powering the delicate flavor of the duck.

It used to have Peking duck hanging in the window with photos of the owner along with influential customers on the wall. All now disappeared, the ducks because of health and safety legislation. However the duck was as good as ever and is recommended. The restaurant is good value and we ate there 3 times. Charging for the nuts is a bit OTT but we realised they were an additional cost and refused them, however we did need the hand wipes and a decent napkin would be a welcome addition to the service which is good.",4,,,,,,

If you go here, I'd recommend staying with ordering drinks only. They at least tasted good and aren't priced as ridiculous.",4,,,,,,

We waited nearly 6 minutes to get seated when the restaurant was half full at best. Waiters walked past us, had enough time to have conversations with each other but not to look over, notice us, and seat us, despite our many attempts to call out to them/get their attention. When we finally did manage to get their attention, we requested for a booth but they told us we couldn’t sit there because it had yet to be cleared. We told them that we were fine with waiting for it to be cleared but then they said that all (there were about 4) of the booths had been pre reserved so we couldn’t sit there anyway. Fair enough, but at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon, that seems almost paltry for an excuse. But never mind, I can accept that I suppose. Next, the menu: ranges from $16 (truffle fries, soup) to an eye popping $38.50 for pork ribs, with the average menu item being around $29. Nevertheless, we gave the lobster bisque a try. The bread bowl came slightly soggy, the bisque slightly cold. The egg was... an egg. We decided to save ourselves more grief and left, but that brief foray into the world of gudetama cost us $16++.

The cheesy sweet potato fries with beef is a starter you absolutely have to get. The amount of cheese is very generous, and it feels like you’re biting into a slice of pizza with each bite. The smoked salmon eggs benedict was yummy too, with very generous portions.

There were about 5 staff that unfortunately weren’t too proficient in English. We had been referred to this place by our hotel concierges at the Shangri La. Our experience started with them pointing to a plate of peanuts and a pre-package hand wipe and asking us if we wanted them for $3 and $1. (I’ve never had to pay for a plate of peanuts before, ha!). Long story short, the staff were not friendly at all and any questions we asked seemed to put them out. We ordered the chili crab and the sauce it came in was tasty but the crab itself was not very flavorful. At 80 Singapore dollars I had hoped it would have been better. It was not worth the price at all. Feel free to give it a go if you want to, maybe you’ll have a better experience than we did. I should have trusted Trip Advisor and not the concierge ;)",2,,,,,,

The whole experience was out of this world! You are first greeted by the gentle smile and polite tone of one of the hosts. I'm using the word ""host"" because through out our meal we felt that we are appreciated guests having our breakfast at the middle eastern generous house. If you throw your sight behind the counter you'd notice a kind lady manning the kitchen with the same care she'd put in preparing meals for her family at home. A true home cooking experience. Saturday was calm to the extent that the food was served at our table before we finished paying our bill. (As I came to understand from the host it's almost a full house at lunch hour on weekdays). As for the food, three words pretty much sums it up; Tasty, Healthy and high quality (okay 4!) the best ingredients are finely picked and almost everything is cooked with the finest olive oil. Dishes are not deep fried but carefully prepared in the oven to produce the healthiest possible combination out of these dishes. My eyes almost popped out checking the Mosakka and Koshary plates that other people ordered. I'm definitely going back to try each one of these delicacies.",5,,,,,,

It’s definitely my favourite place to go to for delicious and healthy Mediterranean food. Owned by an Egyptian man and a lovely Singaporean lady, the food is always prepared fresh with love. I usually grab the Falafel Pita and Hummus, and I haven’t found another place in SG that does it so well. It’s also vegetarian and vegan friendly. I’d recommend that people visit out of the office lunch time hours. Located on the cusp of the CBD, it gets quite crowded during lunch time (for good reason) and expect long wait times because the food is prepared fresh. It’s a small establishment so getting a table during lunchtime can be tough too. I’d recommend swinging by after 2pm for those who want a quiet lunch.",5,,,,,,

All good till I arrived at the restaurant. The staff said they had some families with kids (did not tell us the actual extent of how many) but would place us at a quiet corner. Sound good. Unfortunately it turn out that there were a lot of kids including babies and they were placed on both sides of the restaurant, hence, no matter where you sit, one will be surrounded by kids running and screaming around and babies crying. It was literally like a chaotic zoo in this big French restaurant which one would expect to find peace during meal. The food was alright, a bit underwhelming for the price. On top of that, I end up with a massive headache from the dinner due to the ruckus (first time having that).

I was perplexed so went to enquire with the staff. People were waiting in line to get seated while the staff were still trying to turn over the tables. We only managed to get seated at 4pm. This was bad time management and it is really unacceptable coming from St. Regis. Although we started our afternoon tea late, they did not rush us to finish by 5:30pm and we stayed till about 6pm.

First when we arrived we were surprised to see each table had clotted cream and jam already laid out on the tables. Not sure how long they have been out but our clotted cream had already began to melt; in this current pandemic surely it is not hygienic to have food items laid out before guests even arrive. The cups were not properly washed as well and there were bits of what appeared to be dried vegetable on the tea cup. There was no hand sanitiser or wipes or little paper/plastic bags to keep your face masks which is surprising as it is now common for most restaurants, especially in a so called six star hotel. The food was average, the mini lobster brioche was not very good and the brioche tasted like it was a few days old. The wait staff also seemed to be overwhelmed and it was hard to get their attention; probably understaffed considering it was a fully packed restaurant. Overall considering the price and amount of food, you can get better quality food at better prices at other 5 star hotels high teas. Would not come back again. ",3,,,,,,

Limoncello Pizza and Grill,"95 Robertson Quay Rivergate, Singapore 238256 Singapore",Ophir77,"May 19, 2020","I believe that first impressions do matter, and when I receive warm genuine smiles and pronto service as soon as I enter a restaurant (helping my mum in a wheelchair through the narrow entrance and adapting an appropriate space for her to sit), I am close to being sold; fingers crossed that the food meets up to expectation. The location of this restaurant along the Singapore River at Robertson Quay and its elegant white and grey decor make for an absolutely charming setting. We chose to sit at a big, bare wooden table, which contrasted with most of the more elegant white linen covered tables. It offered a lovely view of the outdoor scene through the glass wall. Service was very prompt as drinks and bread were served while we pondered on what to order. We decided to share a pizza for a starter and chose the Limoncello pizza with beef sausage, porcini and button mushrooms with white base, mozzarella and parmesan, freshly prepared in their own stone pizza oven. This turned out delicious with well-balanced flavours, something worth coming back for. For mains, we had two orders of the Veal Cutlet Milanese, one Grilled Lamb Chop (2 pieces) and two Grilled Angus Tenderloin. Although all dishes were tasty, we felt that more creativity could have gone into the sides to make them a little more unique rather than something one could easily whip up in a home kitchen. On the other hand, some people may be quite content with the simple vegetables offered with more focus on the quality and preparation of the meat. To round off the meal, we ordered Tiramisu, which was served in a glass. This was delicious, and one of the better ones we have tasted. We also ordered a portion of Profiteroles for sharing. This was also good, but could have been a tad more moisty soft. For private functions, there are two rooms to choose from, the B&W room for up to 24 diners and the Wine Cellar room for 10 to 16 diners. The restaurant, which fronts the Robertson Bridge and the shady tree-lined riverwalk, also offers alfresco dining. As it is separated from the row of cafes and restaurants further along the river, it has a quieter and larger private area that works well for us. My husband and I are looking forward to celebrating our 35th anniversary at Limoncello, and if dine-in is still not available by then (post circuit breaker), we will still order their pizza for takeaway.",5,,,,,,

I came across this restaurant in Chope and thought, why not try it since I was getting bored of my usual choices. It was located quite far from the area i usually venture around and finally found the place after some walking along the river at a corner. The restaurant felt extremely posh and I was slightly disappointed, since we didn't make any reservation, they could only place us in between two tables with customers rather than tables by the glass which were all empty. In terms of service, the servers were all male and paid good attention, not taking away our plates too quickly, and timed our meal perfectly. The wine was superb but on the higher end, as always italian wine are the BEST! I had linguine al granchio which blew me away, the crabmeat were really fresh and not too over-whelming. My partner has lamb which were perfectly cooked, partnered with mint sauce, which went really well with the red wine.

Basket of bread was automatically brought to the table. Half Burrata was served at 7pm. Pretty fast. Anyway it’s an easy dish to make. Don’t quite like the taste of an older Parma though. Burrata has a nice milky taste. But would prefer greens with my Burrata. My Margherita pizza was served at 7.15pm. This pizza is not of my liking. Too salty and the base is too wet. If you like thick side crust, this is for you. I like the thin ones. The northern type. Next one served up was Spagetti Seafood linguine. Presentation was different. Plating looks messy but I guess the chef was trying to show the ingredients that were in the dish. It was quite nice except that you need to remove the shell from the prawns. I had Linguine Squid Ink. Find that the squids have been slightly overcooked. Tiramisu is not my style. They have more cream in it. The espresso soaked fingers are all found in the middle, very wet. If you like a tiramisu with more cream in it. You’ll like this one. At 7.35pm, waiter came by to ask if we knew that we need to vacate the table at 7.45pm. After awhile, another came by to tell us that we agreed to leave at 7.45pm on the phone when reservation was made. Yes, yes, we know. But using a little empathy and sense, gobbling down your food in less than 30 minutes? Honestly, I prefer a quiet dinner than get urged to get out quick! Servers were all polite. I think you need to be a frequent diner there to get big smiles from their personnel there!",3,,,,,,

Everything seems fine, the room was cozy and the decor make by the housekeeping team was fantastic. Only down point was the restaurant (Beast and Butterfly) where we had breakfast the following day at 9.30am, service was terrible and shocking! It came across that there was this associate name “Ma Qin” if I will to recall correctly treated her customer like a PRISONER and I’m serious about it! Upon she serving my table food, she slam the food on my table! And best of all, the food was place at the corner of the table where is not where I and my wife will seated! Furthermore, the item on the plate nearly flew off and she just walk off from our table! This is totally unacceptable and is kind of shocking! It made us felt like we are in some sort of prison Movie where prisoner food are been throw or left upon and this is not what millennium service standard are all about! Even nearby coffee shop server can serve their food with some form basic courtesy by placing the food nicely in front of the customer and not by slamming, throwing or placing the food somewhere else. On the other hand, Ma Qin seem to have a doesn’t care attitude and not a single apologise back to us. Even when I brought it up to her manager, still not a single apologise from her! Is kind of disappointing and it just got us a bad hotel experience and make us think twice if we will to celebrate any important day again at your hotel.",1,,,,,,

Ordered a Chilean Merlot which didn’t taste nice (not restaurant’s fault) and a New York strip to go with the wine as wife and I had dinner earlier. Supposed to be done medium but steak was over cooked and dry. The taste was no better than a cheaply priced steak from local food court. The service was friendly and prompt except for being chased off at 10.20pm by the Filipino manager who claimed they had to play safe in order not to flout the 10.30pm alcohol consumption rule. While I understand restaurants are careful, it felt like we’re being chased away early as he literally stood there and ensure we drink up and leave. I’m sure he was 10 mins early because I showed him the timing on my watch (it’s a smart watch with timing synced online and not manually adjusted). Judging by how quiet the restaurant was on a Christmas Eve (as compared to Brewerkz next door), something must be wrong somewhere.

The burger was dressed with cheddar cheese, fried onions with lettuce, raw onion, tomato and pickle on the side. I also asked to have the bacon on the side. Even got mayo for my fries.

I visited here two days ago and found a surprise that I would have never expected...no baked potato soup. This is a staple of Black Angus and could even be call a signature dish but this Black Angus has decided to eliminate it from their menu. The waitress said “many people have complained”. Duh, wonder why? When it’s a signature dish, everyone expects it. Not only was this a disappointment, so was the prime rib. I ordered an 8 oz piece medium but what I got was a piece definitely medium rare and tough as shoe leather. The outer edges was edible but the center was so rare that I could not eat it. For anyone that knows Singapore, restaurant service is not the best and after the waitress dropped off my food, not only did she not check to see if everything was ok, she just disappeared. I ate the outer edges and left the rest. I’ve included a photo of what was left and it is most certainly rare. When the waitress finally showed up to take my plate, I told her the meat was very rare and very tough, she just shrugged it off and brought my check. I doubt I’ll ever go back.",1,,,,,,

I had come on a monday night so the restarunt was fairly quiet and relaxed. I loved the food so much that 5 weeks later I brought my family with me on a friday. This is where the problems started. We ordered the eggplant parmeasn and it didn't taste fresh. The eggplant was chewy and it tasted like it was cooked days ago as opposed to fresh and for the high price tag on the dish that was very dissapointing. We also ordered the caprese salad and again was dissapointed as the mozeralla didn't feel fresh at all and was frankly mediorce. I decided to also order some pizza as the last time I visited the pizza was great. Sadly the pizza was just o.k, it tasted fine but was lacking in salt and other basic flavours.

I ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio with some veggies while my husband ordered Pollo In Padella and both turned out quite bad. The pasta was soaked in olive oil with no flavor whatsoever. The chicken that my husband ordered came with over-cooked and limp looking asparagus and completely runny white wine sauce. The mashed potato was also runny. Overall, it was a complete disappointment and let down. The only saving grace was their house pour Pinot Grigio. For a bill of $130 for 3 dishes you'd expect the food to be atleast decent. No complaints about the service though. Don't think will go back there any time soon.",2,,,,,,

Some minutes after ordering and looking at the pictures of the suspiciously glazy food we decided to ask the kind waiter if in case they use MSG please not to cook for us. He went to the kitchen and came back saying sorry the food is ready but there is only MSG in the salt. This statement was absolute BS because there is no salt with MSG!!! It means they do not use salt, but just drench everything in glutamat! My wife only ate the rice, I ate all the rest and had a very hard digestion. We paid the pricey bill including the 10% service charge without being asked about the meal and left. They obviously knew that we knew.

Alma By Juan Amador,"22 Scotts Road Goodwood Park Hotel Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore 228221 Singapore",Joseph C,"December 27, 2020","My heavenly experience in Alma began with the 100% Sangiovese red wine from San Felice Campogiovanni Brunello di Montalcino Riserva II Quercione – surely when I sipped the top 1% of all wines in the world, I knew I just had to savour the taste and let it linger, and forget about finding the words to describe the taste of this exquisite vintage. Next came Alma’s signature potato bread that oozed with aroma with its warm texture that is perfect for the spread of Bordier Smoke Butter, leaving me to crave for more, and yes, I did end up eating all three pieces served in the beautiful wooden box laden with coffee beans. My first course of today’s lunch was the popular Crispy Tofu – when my teeth sank into the tofu with the blend of wild mushroom, truffle and foie gras, it was ecstatic – the mix between hard and soft for the palate is like consuming sweet music to the ears. When the second course Boston Losbter was served, it was so picturesque I halted to admire the dish – the Angel Hair pasta and broccoli formed the mountainous terrain with the top flattened by the lobster boulders while the Hijiki Seaweed projected the source of multiple waterfalls cascading down the mountains. The finale of the 3-course lunch ended with “Poire Belle Helene” with Alma’s new dessert – with the unique pouring of passion fruit juice with (jin xuan) tea onto the vanilla poached pears, served with 72% chocolate, whipped cream and roasted almonds. I was mesmerized by the balance of flavours (the bitterness in the chocolate that contrasted with the sweetness of the pear and cream) and balance of textures (the soft juice with tea contrasted the crunch of almonds and the firm pear). If you want to experience how food could be served to titilate your palate and senses, go to Alma.",5,,,,,,

We were given undivided attention and each dish was carefully explained. When I stepped out to go to the ladies, Syed promptly stepped in to start a conversation with my husband. As we were the last to leave, we were also given a tour of the exquisite Whisky Room, and even offered to use the room as background for some photo taking opportunities to remember the day by.

Alma By Juan Amador,"22 Scotts Road Goodwood Park Hotel Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore 228221 Singapore",pauyuen,"February 11, 2020","Although the food is supposed to be modern European, we liked the use of Japanese ingredients such as the pear and 'june plum'. We also liked how some of the food, like the langoustine,was so fresh it was served sashimi style. The A5 Ohmi beef was also excellent. Without using chilli, the chef managed to add 'spice' to some of his dishes, with the use of ingredients like fresh radish. As expected, the dishes were beautifully presented - but what we found more important was the delicious blends of textures and taste, including the snacks served before the main course. The potato bread was also very delicious. The only negative point is that if you are hungry, you might need more of the potato bread. However, this was not an issue as the restaurant happily served more bread when asked - my husband took 6 pieces of the bread, which he enjoyed and helped to fill him up. I was full just eating the snacks, the main dishes, and the desserts. Loved the canele dessert (served as part of the petite 'ha') as it was made with smoked gula melaka.",5,,,,,,

They serve delicious soup of the day in small little cups, I’ve had the tomato n mushroom - both lip smacking authentic goodness. I had 2 servings of the beef hump - tender, fatty and melt in your mouth goodness. The chicken livers were crispy on the outside n oh so tender on the inside. I think I ate 6 livers!

The staff follows with attention, asking if people wanted another round of meat type. The buffet salad has a good variety and is good. The variety of meat is not as much as in a real churrascaria, what is understandable however I felt it very limited, soon after the start, the service was all in a rush bringing meat after meat, while we were not able to finish on the servings, I would expect the servers to dose the timing, we had to ask them to slow down. Some meats were not grilled to the point I have experienced before, either too early, not hot enough/ warm or missing salt (and I don't like salty meat). It was the only churrascaria offering grilled chicken liver (what I felt interesting). The grilled pineapple that usually is good was very green, not sweet and not well grilled. At the end the final bill was around SGD70 a person (just the main with some drinks, no desserts and coffee). Disappointed for the quality of the food based on the price we paid for.

The staff treat you like friends instead of customers, and there is genuine warmth in them wanting to ensure you have the best possible experience. They get to know you and they often recognise repeat customers and great them like buddies. This is the restaurant which I often use to host friends as it has fantastic ambiance.

Welcomed by a lady staffmember and promptly seated. Went for the $49 all you can eat deal. The buffet has typical Brazilian dishes like aipim frito (fried manioc/cassava) and palmito (hearts of palm, nicely grilled instead of cold). Farofa, feijoada, and caldinho available upon request. Then the meats started coming, including the star cut - the picanha, perfectly salted and grilled Brazilian style with a nice, smoky aroma. There is a reason why churrasco in Brasil is the paixao nacional, national passion because there is an art to grilling the meat, turning it to achieve the perfect temperature. Other cuts were equally delicious - maminha/alcatra, costelinha de boi (beef shortrib), picanha com alho (picanha laced with garlic), coracao/chicken hearts, etc. Pao de queijo was served on the table and two sauces - vinagrete and a sweet mint sauce (presumably for diners who prefer it for their lamb). They even have Guarana Antartica! Excellent service by the passadores/staff including the carioca Brazilian gentleman. The music coming through the soundsystem started off with Spanish guitar instrumentals (including a version of Manolo Escobar's Y Viva Espana) when they first started the dinner service, gradualling changing to Brazilian music including bossa nova (we heard Agua de Beber).

The majority of the meat however is just average, and over salted. Perhaps coming from a part of the world where the meat is of high quality my expectations were too high. The pork/ham came off a round processed roll not leg ham. Poor quality cuts of lamb and beef except the beef rib which was good and tenderloin was ok. Chicken was 90% bone and the fish was almost inedible. We have been to many Brazilian BBQs joints around the world and this falls well short unfortunately. Not bad just not great.

The beef comes later - they have five different types of beef, and it's best to take as much as you can as it won't come back. While they have to turn a profit, it would be polite for the beef to come back some of the time. Perhaps I was disappointed because I had high expectations but I have tasted better outside Singapore.

Even our American friends agree this is one of the best churrascaria they've ever tasted. Selections at the salad bar are HUGE, it can satisfy both Western & Asian tastes. Try the banana fritters, Mango salad, fried baby spinach & other spicy mixed veggies which we never found somewhere else. Beware though: the sald bar can fill up your stomach before the meats come!

To be honest, we didn’t set our expectation too high on their food. We were like “they are just a restaurant with a view”, just like what we experienced from other restaurants with a view as well. For our mains, we ordered their wagyu tri-tip and mushroom risotto and to our surprise, this is by far the best restaurant with not just a view but a delectable food. The wagyu melts in your mouth and the risotto is very flavourful. We also had oysters, seafood medley, pistachio ice cream and chocolate tart and we enjoyed every bit of it. It is not just the food that captured my attention but also their impeccable service. Your server Jayson did a very good job. He was very professional. We were also served by Joyce and she made our experience here very memorable. We felt very special they way she made sure that we will have a great night and she always check on us without being rude. She even volunteered to take photo of us outside. So sweet! She’s more than just a professional server. She treats every guest very special. She also invited us to try out their lunch, she described it more than what we can imagine so we will definitely try it soon. we might request her to be our server on our next visit or you can request her if you are planning to visit here. Your servers may be wearing masks but good job on training them to still show good emotions through their eyes. We really really enjoyed celebrating our anniversary her ",5,,,,,,

Upon arriving on that day itself, I was greeted by 4 beautiful ladies ( hostess) and was lead by Ms Birdie ( yup, that’s right, that’s her name for real ) to the table. They acknowledged me that the table in the open were still in preparation and will lead me to once it’s ready. Well, I don’t mind to wait. We checked on the menu and placed our orders. Waiters and waitresses were really helpful and attentive to our needs. When the table was ready, we went out but again, we were back inside as we were afraid for the rain sorry to trouble you guys.

This was another restaurant that I had heard lots of good things about and we were not disappointed. Located on Level 33 of MBFC Tower 1, I guess one of the primary reasons to come is for the view of the Bay Area......it is exceptional (especially on a clear dry night like we had). The restaurant offers both inside and outside seating (on their deck area). A booking is essential if you want to sit outside. The ambience of the restaurant was “clean smart causal” - decorations all very tastefully done and the service was exceptional, the staff add to the overall experience. The food was extremely tasty, all freshly cooked and beautifully presented. I had the Raw Hokkaido Scallops and Sirloin Steak (with a few sides thrown in) - both highly recommended. Being it’s own Urban Microbrewery, the selection of beers is good plus they have a pretty decent wine and cocktail list too. All in - decent view, decent food and decent drink makes for a very pleasant dining experience. I was very impressed and will certainly go again. ",5,,,,,,

What a difference 2 years has made the staff were not friendly and were quite rude. The food was very disappointing and at extortionate prices we were left angry. If the food is good then you don’t mind paying that bit more but this food was terrible. We were told you needed to order 5 to 6 dishes between 2 people so we ordered sweet potato fries, regular fries, steak, chicken and mushrooms. We ordered way to much we only needed 1 fries between us and the fillet steak was ok but nothing to wow about and I don’t think you can go wrong with fried chicken. This meal cost £105 and absolutely was not worth the money. We asked for dessert menus but we never got them so we paid and left. Our waitress was not interested in doing her job and the atmosphere in the restaurant was strained, and only half the tables being used more people were drinking outside than in the restaurant.

You may need to search a little to find it but it’s worth the effort in my opinion. The staff was friendly the food was great and we were very happy with everything. We were charged $2.00 for peanuts that were already on the table when we arrived that we never ate and 30 cents each for wet wipes (no napkins), I don’t really agree with this practice and only found out about it after we returned to our hotel. I personally don’t find it to be a huge deal but I would think if you mention it to the staff they would work with you on this if it’s a problem. I would definitely return and I recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a local restaurant for true authentic Dim Sum. ",4,,,,,,

I reckon management has to seriously look into these matter because it spoils our happy day patronising Ikea. Besides having good products, service is equally vital in any businesses. Dont give lame excuses that these local Chinese aunties cant communicate English properly because if their attitude serving customers is abyssal, even their gestures & facial expressions & tone of voice could reflect their rottenness.

Quite difficult to get a table, do go early. Food is delicious, fresh & good. Their signature fried chicken is juicy, tender & very tasty. Every table will sure to have this dish. Next is their Salmon, tasty, yummy & no fishy smell. Like the way they served the potatoes with Brocoli, good way to have kids who don't eat their veggie. The potato is flavorful. Yum Yum.

Marche Movenpick,"252 North Bridge Road Raffles City Shopping Centre #01-17A Raffles City Shopping Centre, Singapore 179103 Singapore",589katherynf,43509,"So we were looking for the Mövenpick Marché like the one in Sommerset and Vivo City (which we love and I will review separately). At first we were disappointed to find that this was only a café version. Also, it is on the complete opposite end of the mall from the parking garage so it was not an easy find. However, once we were settled,we were able to find things on the menu that sparked our interest. The café was clean and the server was fairly attentive. Having been to the other locations, I know that their savory salmon crepe is terrific and can feed two! Also, while their restaurant website lists “rosti,” I didn’t see that favorite on the menu. I decided to try something new, and had high hopes for the salami and mushroom pizza. Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. I like a lot of flavor so if you don’t, you might like this. The crust was crunchy on the edges (a little too toasted for me in some places) and soft in the middle, and there were plenty of toppings. The salami didn’t have enough taste for me compared to the “Olivia” pizza at “Spizza!” I found that this was the same for the open faced prosciutto and sun-dried tomato sandwich. However, my daughter said the goat-cheese open faced sandwich with fig jam was one of the best things she had ever eaten. She wouldn’t even let me try a bite! I have to say that their website menu isn’t very helpful. I think they’re trying to be “hip and current” instead of simply informational. If nothing else, this café offers everything from pizza and pasta, to steaks and chops. You will definitely find something for everyone here.",3,,,,,,

Ordered the signature breakfast. Sadly it wasn’t quite what I expected. The scrambled egg was probably from a mix as it tasted weird after some time. The sausages and bacon pieces were small and a tad too oily for me. Saving grace was the one slice of toasted tomato and a tiny portion of greens. The latte which came in a glass got cold pretty quickly. The ambience was nice though with the morning breeze. There are pretty potted flowers and herbs along side the tables.,3,,,,,,

We were looking for a place to meet and have dinner and finally decided on Marche at Raffles City as it was centrally located, above MRT and had ample parking. We order: 2 salads (romain + prawns) (spinach + chicken). the chicken was very dry and hard. We had 2 pastas (aglio olio seafood) (beef in red sauce). I think the pasta had MSG...:(. We tried to 2 savory wraps (prawn) (beef) - this was nothing to shout about though. We tried one rib eye steak and cut it into many small slices for all to try. I think the steak was good. The final part was desserts and we order apple tarts, pancake with banana and nutella. The baked apple tarts was really good and it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The service was quite ok and attentive. The waitress helped us with extra plates, cutlery, water and also helped us with taking our group photos. There was a live music and it was quite noisy but bearable. We could not see the performer due to a huge pillar blocking the view and guess this help to block out some of the sound and also minimized distractions.

Seemed to have improved even more since our last visit some years ago. (My husband and I used to come here alot until we had our child. Then when our kid was older and we could eat out more easily, we tried coming here once but it was full .. more about table reservations later.) The crepes are really delicious!! We had the ham and emmental cheese, and chicken with caramelised onions. Can’t decide which one is better! We ordered the Geraldine’s favourite sweet crepe (baked apple filling with sea salt caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream). This is to die for! I watch my calorie intake very carefully. But with this, I’m more than happy to eat more than my share!! I haven’t had any better crepe in Singapore. Now the restaurant takes reservation (with a deposit paid up front which will be taken off your bill; entirely fair in my view) which makes it much easier to ensure that we get a table. We will be back for sure!",5,,,,,,

However, despite the much appreciated prices, the fine dining experience is not the same and not worthy of the price. Service is attentive and steaks are still cooked to perfection. But expected more for ambience and thoughtful touches from a Michelin restaurant. While it’s always been dim, they used to bring a light to help diners read better. Instead, the servers just brought a menu with bigger font. Despite well spaced tables, the place is to noisy for a good dinner conversation. Server did not highlight the additional sauces and individual sides that we could have ordered to complement our steaks or did they caution on the size of the steaks and suggest ordering 2 or the porterhouse to share between our family of 4. The free dessert was the soufflé but was expecting a choice of flavors rather than the standard lemon. The restaurant did not even provide a holder for our masks which some restaurants that charge a fraction of the price provides since masks are compulsory now and is more hygienic being kept away during dining. Overall, expected more, not worth the price. What happened to fine dining in Singapore?",3,,,,,,

Although the waitress mentioned that it has more marbling than the lean fillet mignon, the marbling is not very well distributed like wagyu and we felt it’s just fats in some parts and some parts are lean so the taste is not perfect.

The new decor is nice, as dark as the previous restaurant and would feel quite intimate if it wasn’t for the noise. Portions are big, and the meat, while good, felt short of my expectations. We had the ribeye in the bone and the filet mignon. The meat was quite lean, which is fine, but I thought the taste was rather dull. Salads are decent and fresh, desserts overloaded with sugar but still good. Overall disappointing and not worth the whopping prices. The final touch was the waitress whispering to the unfortunate gentleman who received the bill that “gratuities were appreciated”. I guess. Service was good and professional beside that.",3,,,,,,

We've been to many Morton's in the world, and the food & service was always great. So when we were looking for something a little special for New Year's Day, we chose Morton's. We knew it's going to be expensive, that's probably why we haven't been here before. Anyway, so we went, had drinks at the bar first (very nice, love their steak sandwiches!) and then proceeded to the restaurant. We were seated in one of the corners and had a huge table and the seats are comfy too. First we ordered another drink each, then we shared a starter (jumbo prawn cocktail) and then we both had steak with 2 sides to share. We didn't have desert, but 2 more glasses of wine. The food and service was top notch from start to finish, absolutely nothing to complain. The steaks were so good... when we ordered the bill, we tried guessing how much it would be and although I thought we both added a few extras here and there, we never expected to get a bill for SGD 520.Wow! Despite the quality of the service, food and all, we will probably not go back soon, as there are equally good steakhouses in Singapore for almost half the price. So sad, I do love my Morton's though. Will go back when in the US later this year though.",4,,,,,,

(The debit card is a great thing as it relieves the vendors of having to cook and handle cash simultaneously.) Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour (10:05 pm) as the Singapore Laksa had been sold out and its substitute Char Kway Tiaw was a big disappointment, unlike the Fish Ball soup, which compared well with the same dish served in Terminal 2. Also, the late hour must have something to do with the rudeness of the Char Kway Tiaw vendor and the less than happy mood of the debit card seller.

The payment is through a Card you purchase at a sole cashier and then used to pay at the stall. Great system and the card is valid for a year! I will certainly visit again on my next trip via Singapore.",4,,,,,,

The Antidote started out as a bar in the Fairmont hotel so most people do not associate it as a venue for lunch or dinner. Recently it’s become quite popular as a venue for high tea. The high tea is very well presented, but the real deal is it’s lunch offering. It’s become our destination of choice for any family celebration like birthdays or anniversary. We normally celebrate our functions with a good lunch and Antidote turned out to be really exceptional. Gisselle, the manager was a lovely lady who did her utmost to make the day memorable for us. Maggie who served us was also an exceptional personnel. Then there is Chef Jacky whom we got to meet and know. He is an exceptional chef. Only 31 years old, he cooks up such wonderful dishes. I’ve been to One Star Michelin venues whose food does not measure up to his. So their 3 course lunch offering is a steal for the quality and taste.

Server said NO this is their policy. We tried to talk to him nicely can he please ask his manager as this is too bizarre since Prego is also part of Fairmont. He said NO again this is their policy.

Their Singapore Sling is too sweet and their Rabbit Hole cocktail tasted just okay (nothing too special) considering the price you pay for. Although their classic mojito and their whiskey-based drink called Donkey Kong are excellent. Their spirits and wine selection is I would say decent. Special mention to Gab!

The food there is always of excellent quality and the variety of dessert is excellent. What makes this dining experience even more special was when Chef Jack offered to cook something for my mum who has alzheimers and cannot take regular food. I was pleasantly surprised as i had called earlier to ask if there is the alacarte option and they had said no. Later on, the waitress also asked if we wanted some scones as the chef can bake some for us. Warm scones freshly baked! Really wonderful.

Special shout out to Chef William and Chef Kai Sen, who tended to my mum's no-beef diet restriction, and offered us some savory tarts and delicious tender pork belly skewers. The laksa impressed my mum quite a bit and it's pretty on par with the pork belly skewers. There was a great spread of dessert and I strongly recommend the scones (which you have to order from the service staff as they are not displayed) and the surprisingly fragrant sago gula melaka glass. It is a pity that we couldn't try more food or desserts because we were so stuffed, so it definitely gives us an excuse to revisit the place again!",5,,,,,,

My son is not a picky eater but he does love variety. Our latest visit was a touch off the lofty standards we usually expect from the Rose Veranda. Some of the dishes were overcooked, or took some time to be replenished. The service was extremely attentive, and there wasn't a single complaint to be had regarding the staff. There were some dishes which had some seasoning issues, like it was over-salty (the Cajun Chicken - and yet very tough), or bland (funnily enough the Laksa was a bit diluted compared to previously). The desserts were really excellent, BUT, the ice creams were a bit over soft.I know I am really commenting on very marginal issues, because seriously, there is no better place to do afternoon tea in Singapore, but it's really because I love the Rose Veranda so much, and have had so much better from you, that I really want you to do better!

The food trays were not replenished often enough, there was not as much of a selection of desserts and the crème brulee was way undercooked and runny. The most disappointing thing was that there were no scones on offer. You had to ask for them to be specially cooked for you. What is a High Tea without scones, cream and jam?! There always used to be scones and lots more delicious desserts. By 4.30 the chocolate fountain had been switched off and the whole dessert area looked decidedly sad!

I asked if the placed was reserved but it wasn't. The food was nice, however the buffet was rather small. The view was towards the pool was ok, Overall, it was nothing special . I don't know why this lace is so famous. Fullerton Hotels have several high tea options that i think are more attractive. Given the fact that waiters were not were friendly I don't think I would go back here. ",3,,,,,,

However this was more like a mini buffet lunch. In respect to the tea, there was a good range of teas however these were just tea bags and not made with tea leaves. In regard to the coffee this was a non event. I ordered a latte and received coffee from a machine like the office coffee machine or those in the airline lounges, not very nice at all. For a hotel as reputable at Shangri La, I would have thought that a latte would have come in a latte glass and be barista made coffee, especially as this was a high tea meal. There were no scones and only a fairly small dessert bar. The only good thing about our visit here was the great customer service we received from Arianne who ensured I got a proper latte and provided good overall customer service. Also be aware there are two types of high tea, apparently one with tea and cake which is around $35 and the high tea lunch which is around $60. We booked for the cheaper one online but were just seated and told to help ourselves so were not aware that two options existed, we were then charged for the more expensive option. I did not see anyone in the room having the tea and cake option which we later learned is served using the traditional 3 tier cake stand. I have little good to say about my experience at this venue and I feel was below standard of what would be expected from a Shangri La.",3,,,,,,

There is a tiny selection each of dim sum, salad, western, japanese (sashimi), bread,soup and stations for making your own laksa and hot chocolate. Nothing particularly memorable.  Service was prompt and friendly.",3,,,,,,

Wide spread for both Savory & Sweet items. Their signature dish Laksa (Slight spicy dish. White noodles soaking in coconut milk gravy & seafood) is a must try. My friends have gone for 2-4 helpings! Value for money too. Some credit cards offer 15% discount. When you asked for your bill, service staffs are nice to inform you on the credit card promotion. Really enjoyed our catch up session for a pack of 11 of us. Service staffs have been very helpful with our request too. Complimentary parking coupons provided.We’ll definitively return.",5,,,,,,

Nothing exceptional. What was most disappointing was when a senior chef told his Junior off, in front of the buffet line, with vulgarities, for not replenishing the food. That's not the experience one should get in a 5 star hotel and a Singapore institutio ",1,,,,,,

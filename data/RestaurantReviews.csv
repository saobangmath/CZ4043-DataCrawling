I reckon management has to seriously look into these matter because it spoils our happy day patronising Ikea. Besides having good products, service is equally vital in any businesses. Dont give lame excuses that these local Chinese aunties cant communicate English properly because if their attitude serving customers is abyssal, even their gestures & facial expressions & tone of voice could reflect their rottenness.

Ikea Cafeteria,"60 Tampines North Drive 2, Singapore 528764 Singapore",Yamamus,8-Nov-12,"This is a typical example of an IKEA. It's larger than the other one in Singapore, but pretty typical size by comparison to stores in North America. Like all IKEA stores, it is bright and has high ceilings, and there's the restaurant, child's area, etc. The prices do seem to be less of a bargain compared to the IKEA stores in the US and Canada. Aside from this, there's nothing to warrant any major accolades, but also nothing to warrant any major complaints. Some minor issues are its great distance from town, and the extremely long lines to buy an ice cream cone--which you make yourself once you buy a token at the counter. They should just invest in a token dispenser.",3.0

But because of this, the in-house cafeteria becomes too crowded, especially during the weekends and during lunch hours on weekdays. The cafeteria has just become too small to support the number of shoppers who visit IKEA. As a result, the place is packed, messy and there is a lot of stress trying to find a table as it is a self-service cafeteria. The food is really very average although the drinks are cheap. It would ideally be a place for one to stop for a drink before continuing to shop on the lower level. But who needs the stress and the crowds?

I visited here two days ago and found a surprise that I would have never expected...no baked potato soup. This is a staple of Black Angus and could even be call a signature dish but this Black Angus has decided to eliminate it from their menu. The waitress said ‚Äúmany people have complained‚Äù. Duh, wonder why? When it‚Äôs a signature dish, everyone expects it. Not only was this a disappointment, so was the prime rib. I ordered an 8 oz piece medium but what I got was a piece definitely medium rare and tough as shoe leather. The outer edges was edible but the center was so rare that I could not eat it. For anyone that knows Singapore, restaurant service is not the best and after the waitress dropped off my food, not only did she not check to see if everything was ok, she just disappeared. I ate the outer edges and left the rest. I‚Äôve included a photo of what was left and it is most certainly rare.

However, when we reached the restaurant 15 mins before the reservation time, the seat was not ready. Like other walk-in customers, we had to wait. Seemingly, the walk-in customers were able to enter the restaurant much faster than we did. When the manager finally managed to clear the queue, he asked us whether we mind the counter seats. Erm... but we made a reservation. If we had not made a reservation and just walked in, then we should be fine with the counter seats given the queue. We rejected the offer, and then we were made to wait again. By our reservation time, we were still not yet seated. That defeat the purpose of having a reservation after all. The restaurant was understaff apparently. Food wise, the pork burata was awful. The pork was too grilled and dry and we find it unpleasant smell. Then we waited very Long for the yakitori platter. Most of the food were served almost consecutively except for the yakitori platter. We surmised that it was overlooked. When it finally came, we would agree that it tasted better than the pork burata. However, the mid wings were too overgrilled and we tasted the burnt taste. I had to make do by removing the skin just to eat that pathetic mid wing. Oh ya, the chawanmushi was really bland, almost tasteless. Seriously, I don‚Äôt know why the queue there. But I know for sure, that‚Äôs my first and the last time there. ",2.0

But after taking first bite on the Tiger Prawns, I was disappointed to find it greasy and crispy enough. The batter has soaked up quite a bit of oil.

We waited nearly 6 minutes to get seated when the restaurant was half full at best. Waiters walked past us, had enough time to have conversations with each other but not to look over, notice us, and seat us, despite our many attempts to call out to them/get their attention. When we finally did manage to get their attention, we requested for a booth but they told us we couldn‚Äôt sit there because it had yet to be cleared. We told them that we were fine with waiting for it to be cleared but then they said that all (there were about 4) of the booths had been pre reserved so we couldn‚Äôt sit there anyway. Fair enough, but at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon, that seems almost paltry for an excuse. But never mind, I can accept that I suppose. Next, the menu: ranges from $16 (truffle fries, soup) to an eye popping $38.50 for pork ribs, with the average menu item being around $29. Nevertheless, we gave the lobster bisque a try. The bread bowl came slightly soggy, the bisque slightly cold. The egg was... an egg. We decided to save ourselves more grief and left, but that brief foray into the world of gudetama cost us $16++.

The cheesy sweet potato fries with beef is a starter you absolutely have to get. The amount of cheese is very generous, and it feels like you‚Äôre biting into a slice of pizza with each bite. The smoked salmon eggs benedict was yummy too, with very generous portions. Service-wise, upon being informed that it was our friend‚Äôs birthday, they brought out a huge Gudetama birthday sign and a complementary dessert plate with a little cake (: my only gripe about the cafe is that it is pretty pricey. Each Main costs about $24 and above, and their sweet drinks cost about $8.50, all before GST.

The restaurant looks good and is in a nice location, thats about all the positives we had from our experience. It was a Sunday evening and after seating us outside which was what we wanted, the staff didnt come back to take out order for drinks or food for 15 mins - after having to wave the wait staff down from outside the window. It seemed like all the wait staff beside two of them were new, they had no idea what was what and cleaning tables all over the place - it wasnt even busy. When we finally got to order it was another 20 mins before our entree of bruschetta came out, the bread was stone cold and half were burnt. One main pizza came out straight after the entree while the rest of us sat and waited for our main pastas which the first one came out 20 mins later and the waiter didnt know what pasta it was nor who ordered it.

As a result, I decided to order a noodle take-away instead, something I haven't tried yet.. It wasn't because I was being adventurous, but because the Pho beef combination, dry yellow curry duck noodles and dry stewed beef noodles were all apparently sold out at close to 4pm on a public holiday. Already, I wasn't too impressed. So, I ordered the Quang style egg noodles which I will never ever buy again. The 3 prawns were a little tough, I'm suspecting they were cooked more than once... Regardless, they were definitely overcooked. The noodles tasted like the local (Singaporean) 'mee pok' but without the springiness. There was barely any flavour to the sauce presuming there was some. Lastly, the one miserly pork rib added, though tasty, was but one miserly piece maybe 2.5inches long, 1 inch wide and an inch thick (bone included). Please note that I didn't wait long to eat this take-away lest it be thought that I had allowed the once fresh bowl of dry noodles to go cold. It was only 5 minutes later that I ate my take-away, in my car. In addition to the disappointing bowl of egg noodles, I had ordered an iced coffee with condensed milk for S$2.50. It tasted so-so and there wasn't much of it to drink anyway. Most of the plastic take-away cup, or should I say 90% of the cup, was ice. There was SO much ice that the, I would presume, hot coffee that was initially brewed then poured into the cup filled with ice, wasn't able to melt even a quarter of the ice... I will still go back to give the sandwich a try since I'm craving for a banh mi to see if their banh mi is as authentic as the ones sold in Vietnam.",2.0

At first we were disappointed to find that this was only a caf√© version. Also, it is on the complete opposite end of the mall from the parking garage so it was not an easy find. However, once we were settled,we were able to find things on the menu that sparked our interest. The caf√© was clean and the server was fairly attentive. Having been to the other locations, I know that their savory salmon crepe is terrific and can feed two! Also, while their restaurant website lists ‚Äúrosti,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see that favorite on the menu. I decided to try something new, and had high hopes for the salami and mushroom pizza. Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. I like a lot of flavor so if you don‚Äôt, you might like this. The crust was crunchy on the edges (a little too toasted for me in some places) and soft in the middle, and there were plenty of toppings. The salami didn‚Äôt have enough taste for me compared to the ‚ÄúOlivia‚Äù pizza at ‚ÄúSpizza!‚Äù I found that this was the same for the open faced prosciutto and sun-dried tomato sandwich. However, my daughter said the goat-cheese open faced sandwich with fig jam was one of the best things she had ever eaten. She wouldn‚Äôt even let me try a bite!

Yes, it was expensive - $184AUD for the 2 of us, but it was the last meal of a 7 week trip so we decided to splurge. We could have eaten much less - the crab they served us would have done for 4 people - so make sure you stipulate the weight, which we didn't. We had prawns steamed with garlic and greens for starters. Be prepared to get messy and to be charged for everything - as in extra bread and even wipes for your hands.

No Signboard Seafood,"414 Geylang Road, Singapore 389392 Singapore",Hai T,27-Jul-17,"Visited this after hearing many good reviews on instagram with particular mention that it is better than Jumbo (I have never been). Went with 2 friends and it's name is exactly like, there is no signboard for it and so can be easy to drive pass and miss it (apparently the street that the restaurant is located on is a red light district however I didn't notice anything to suggest that). Once inside, you'll know you've got the right restaurant. There is a charm to the restaurant set-out with plenty of room to move. The food itself lives up to its reputation. A great selection of seafood to pick from, their menu was huge although I will note that there was a fair few items that we were advised were 'sold out' or 'not in season' which was a little disappointing and led me to believe they may no longer simply serve the dish. We went ahead to order their famous singaporean crab dish we which thoroughly enjoyed and beats any other version we've ever had in Australia. We also ordered their popular 'pepper style' crab as well - BE WARNED, this is not for the faint-hearted, it is a true kick in your face pepper flavour and my two friends could not bear more than 1 piece, it had them sweating more than the Singaporean humidity. I was a huge fan of it though and finished it. I truly recommend it to those who can handle their heat. We ordered a couple of prawn dishes too (butter cereal and steamed garlic, with a unanimous vote that the butter cereal came on top by far. Sambal belacan was delicious and very authentic. One of the biggest drawn down about this restaurant is most definitely price. In saying that, we pay a lot more for seafood in Australia so I didn't not have much issue about pricing and was happy to pay what the bill came to (roughly 280 Singaporan dollars for 2 crab dishes, 2 prawn dishes, 2 mantou buns, sambal belacan dish and beer and coconut juice for all of us). What was annoying to me though was that they charge for everything. We were asked at the beginning if we wanted peanuts at the table (with no indication that it will cost us) and replied yes thinking they were complimentary but later found they charge us for this on the bill. They also charge for wet paper towels and even paper bibs, to which we all purchased as our crab dishes necessitated it. This surcharge could've been made the more acceptable if they had simply just added it within meal prices. Do not visit if you are expecting to have a cheaper to moderate priced meal. However if you are happy to part with some extra money, you will enjoy your meal he ",4.0

We ordered several other dishes which all tasted fine. Service was adequate. The Chilli Crab was fine too. The main downside was that the 3 main restaurants, not just this restaurant charge very high prices for their food. I would say the meal was worth about 1/2 of what we paid. If price is no object, then by all means go ahead, but having been in Vietnam and Bali on this trip, I think its not worth it.

No Signboard Seafood,"414 Geylang Road, Singapore 389392 Singapore",AllanKearney,5-Jul-17,"Took our daughter and boyfriend for their first experience with Singapore Chilli Crab to NSS. I was keen to try the White Pepper Crab - which is apparently a creation of this restaurant, although this is widely debated on the net :-) . We also ordered the black pepper crab, drunken prawns, rice, the soft buns and some bottles of Tiger beer (in my view the only accompaniment for Singapore Chilli Crab!). NSS is set in a noisy open courtyard on a relatively busy street. This is part of its appeal, relatively comfortable but still with that hawker hustle and bustle. The Chilli crab could have been a little more spicy for my tastes, but this was soon remedied with some chopped fresh chilli. The white and black pepper crab were lovely. Succulent juicy flesh with a great balance of spice and heat. The prawns were a bit bland but again, a little chilli in the stock lifted the experience. I wonder whether they had us pegged as chilli newbies and tailored the order accordingly. In any case, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would visit again when in Singapore.

Be warned - the price is quite hefty here. 1kg=80SGD for crab, and often they are sold out on their smallest size. We were offered 1.3kg, which is probably the next best thing, but still rather costly for a crab that size to cost 100SGD. The taste was exotic to us, so we enjoyed it for what it was.

No Signboard Seafood,"414 Geylang Road, Singapore 389392 Singapore",adrianloader,28-Mar-17,"I really want to like this restaurant - it's local and full of character, it's buzzy, has nice service, a great legacy story (poor hawker's stall that couldn't afford a sign board) and an appetising menu. At the end of the day my score is a reluctant four (with a downwards pull to three) on one account - a couple of the dishes we tried (as well as the peanuts) were far too sweet. OK, so the chilli crab has a touch of sugar but steamed fish with a gloopy sauce ? That's just wrong. On the other hand the spicy kang kong was excellent, the bamboo clam was precisely cooked and the fried squid delicious. We eventually gave up on the mains and polished off the starters instead. The beer is cold, the atmosphere fun, the utensils plastic and you can sit in the VIP room if you prefer a cooler environment. If you wish there are some expensive imported ingredients as well as shark's fin soup, unfortunately, which I think should be banned from all Chinese menus worldwide. Locals seem to eat earlier, foreigners a little later. So, do try No Signboard restaurant if you're in the Geylang area but choose wisely and make sure the waiting staff understand your preferences - for instance, the pepper crab would be a much better choice than the chilli crab if you don't have a sweet tooth (and don't mind white pepper).",4.0

As a single person I said I cannot eat a lot of food but I would like to try a couple of things. I was recommended the scallops with XO sauce and chili garlic shrimp. The server asked if I would like rice and I said, yes a cup. She sold me a $20 plate that would serve 4-6 people. The XO scallops were good, the garlic chili shrimp had no flavor and were cold and again I had a plate of rice for six people. The bill they presented me with with the addition of a bear was $120 Singaporean. When I examine the bill, they had double charge me for my shrimp portions. When I presented this to the staff, they laughed and said I will take care of that and remove it for your bill. For a single person they have six or seven scallops, six shrimp, fried rice and a beer for $115 Singaporean, or $80 US was ridiculous.

As you might have heard, this place is famous for its chili crab. And they really earned it because the chili crab was really really reaaaaallly gooood. Almost always ordered chili crab, mantou bread, steamed rice, and Thai coconut for drink. Even just to put the gravy on top of a bowl of steamed rice and put it the mouth was already heavenly! The restaurant is spacious and suitable for business dinner, celebration, or even just for casual eating out with friends/family. Can be quite expensive but it was totally worth it.

I told her that was fine but she had to reflect it in our bill but she didn't seem to understand us. Another waitress came over and said we ordered salted fish so we had to pay the salted fish price and insisted that the dish on our table was salted fish fried rice.

The set includes lobster in butter, abalone, fried shrimp and crab. For crab, you can choose pepper sauce or chili sauce, we chose white pepper as it is said that this restaurant is famous for that one. The lobster is small and sweet, the sauce is nice and I just wish to have Vietnamese toast to use with that. The abalone is with oyster sauce, the abalone is good but the sauce is a little salty. They fried the shrimp with some flour and salt which made it really tasty. The pepper crab is nice, of course, but I don't think it's so significant. I think the pepper crab at Eng Seng restaurant is better. The staffs are nice and helpful. However, it's too pricey. It cost us S$450 for all above with drink and tax and service fee.

The basil chicken eggs benedict was something different and special from the usual eggs benedict, with basil hollandaise over poached eggs and thai basil minced chicken instead of the usual ham/smoked salmon. The poached eggs were on point, with an explosive factor and the minced chicken were juicy and flavourful. However, more toast could have been given as all we got was just 3 tiny triangle shaped wedges that made up only half a slice of toast.

Not bad. The dim sum trollers were great and the food was nice. Problem started when we ordered a la carte. The sweet and sour pork was tasteless and sauce very greasy. We wondered if the pork was cooked thoroughly because it had a funny texture. A member of our group vomited after the meal so sure the pork was not cooked properly. The spicy Aubergine hotpot was not spicy and again lots of oil and cornstarch. Don't order a la carte there and stay away from pork.,2.0

Apparently the world's largest steakhouse chain in the world, they must be doing something right when it comes to steaks, correct? I opted to have the 8-ounce Outback Special prepared medium-rare. It was nicely prepared with each slice oozing some of the meat juices; however, it did appear to dry out as I ate so perhaps it had been on the hot pain just tad bit too long. I also chose to have the steak with coleslaw (interesting crumbly look to it), mashed potatoes (the gravy was incredibly flavourful, absolutely loved it) and grilled onions (slightly bland but went well with the steak).

Price wise is still quite reasonable. The best steak I had here was the prime rib with the special sauce but sadly it is not available for lunch normally. If you will be dining at here often. I would recommend you to get their membership card as it is really worth it. For $40 you would be able to get a membership card which give you 15% discount off total bills everytime you dine which is like you don't have to pay for gst and service charge. You will also get a birthday card which is valid on birthday month which give you 30% off total bills. Lastly you would get a $40 discount card and will be able to use the next visit. So you are actually paying for more benefits. Staff here are friendly and approachable as well. BTW they had complimentary bread as well^^",4.0

The service was awful. They could not make the cocktail off the menu I requested (cucumber martini - ""we don't have that sir""). So I ordered the steakhouse martini. 20 minutes later a ""cucumber martini"" arrived w/o garnish and so sweet that it could accompany a dessert. My steak arrived looking steamed not seared. I ordered (off the menu) the Shiraz Cabernet by the glass. ""Sir we don't have that, we only have the Chianti"" (with the Ch pronounced like in Charlie). On the drink menu the Chianti is ""bottle only"" and is the same price for the bottle as the Shiraz Cabernet (64.90). The Shiraz Caberent is 13.90 for the glass yet they charged me 15.90 for the glass of Chianti. They also automatically included a service charge. I would not have left a tip.

This 'sticker shock' is somewhat mitigated by the overall quality of the food, wide menu selection and breezy American-style service (i.e. we did appreciate solicitous servers inquiring as to how we were enjoying our meal - a rarity in Singaporean restaurants). Our meal was simple, yet well-executed: plump, well-marbled baby back ribs bursting with flavour and falling off the bone; tender black pepper steak bites served sizzling, hot-plated with fries and vegetables. It's important to note that the fries and vegetables are not mere accompaniments or afterthoughts - both were well-cooked with fresh flavour and vibrant taste, neither soggy nor bland as is often the case in inferior establishments. They truly complimented our meal. The restaurant's atmosphere is typical quasi-sports bar, unmemorable save for the good service and tasty food.",4.0

Asking myself : who is in the kitchen and is there anybody qualified to keep up the name ""outback"" !? Calamari : looked like a war ration , i.e very small, as to the calamari themselves it seemed that they had be soaking in cheap (smelly) oil with the ""crust"" (actually no crust) which seemed like breadcrumbs so soaked that it disintegrate in your plate! Pathetic. Spareribs , very so so (on the dry side). A poor very poor salad unappetising !.A big hard burger ... definitely not you expect to find in Outback !

(The debit card is a great thing as it relieves the vendors of having to cook and handle cash simultaneously.) Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour (10:05 pm) as the Singapore Laksa had been sold out and its substitute Char Kway Tiaw was a big disappointment, unlike the Fish Ball soup, which compared well with the same dish served in Terminal 2. Also, the late hour must have something to do with the rudeness of the Char Kway Tiaw vendor and the less than happy mood of the debit card seller.

But at the Singapore Food Street in Terminal 3, we stepped out of the happy land of organization and into the bizarre world of 'rip them off through confusing the hell out of them'. No, you cannot just visit Subway to feed your kids. First you have to buy a special card and fill it with money. How much would you like? No idea! So then we had to go to Subway, pretend to order food with the staff, find out how much it totaled, THEN go back to the card queue, buy a stupid card, THEN go back to Subway, order... and finally sit down to eat. Phew! I grew a beard while this amazing procedure played out. And the people behind the counter proudly told me that they also operate a similar system in Bangkok. So watch out! It seems to me that it is solely designed to get people to over-estimate the amount they need to put on the card: at best it's really inconvenient when you're in a hurry between planes.

It's a little bit of a shame that the hotel doesn't invest in this restaurant a bit more. It's really large but it's never more than half full. It deserves far more patronage because the food is consistently good. I've had Chilli Crab at stalwarts such as Long Beach, but Ah Hoi's is always better somehow - and the mantou is always better. Their satay is always excellent as is their chicken with ginger. The restaurant is also unusual in that it's indoors yet has an outdoorsy feel.",4.0

The claypot beancurd with mixed vegetables is to this day the best thing I have ever eaten! (mainly for the fresh ginger in it). The staff even made me a noodle dish which was not on the menu but equally as delicious. I cannot fault this restaurant in any way, due to the free water, 60 pence bowls of rice and free appetizers with some amazing spicy dipping sauce (sadly I have no idea what it was, but it was great with carrots!).

Ah Hoi's Kitchen,"1A Cuscaden Road Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore Level 4 , Pool Side, Singapore 249716 Singapore",Juliana Z,17-Mar-13,"Stumbled upon this restaurant when exploring the Tanglin area. Perhaps due to its hidden location, not many people patronized the restaurant even on the busy Saturday. The interior provided very laid back atmosphere and the staff were friendly. Located beside the swimming pool on the fourth floor of the Trader's hotel, the restaurant offers indoor seatings and outdoor seatings by the pool. We went on Saturday afternoon, even with indoor seating under the fans, the temperature was a bit high to make any warm dishes enjoyable (they do have air-conditionings but they were not switched on for some reasons). Nevertheless, the dishes were tasty enough for a restaurant targeting mainly expatriates and tourists. The broth of the lobster bee hoon was delicious and the paper chicken was very juicy (a bit on the oily side though). But the lemon chicken was rather average and portion was very small for the price they are charging. The price is on the high side (i.e. 15 dollars instead of 5 for simple fried rice), but it is probably justifiable considering its location.",4.0
Ah Hoi's Kitchen,"1A Cuscaden Road Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore Level 4 , Pool Side, Singapore 249716 Singapore",Staidthere,13-Mar-13,"We ate dinner at Ah Hoi‚Äôs kitchen only because we stayed at the Traders Hotel and we wanted to try local (Malay-Singapore-Indonesian) food in a more expansive atmosphere than a Tanglin Mall basement food court. There were tables both inside and outside by the pool, and we chose a table inside the large hall that was cooled by many large fans. My wife found that the pork ribs were exceptionally delicious, and she enjoyed the ice kacang. My deep fried eggplant with wasabi mayonnaise was very good, and we shared an order of fried mantou. Fresh juices, including fresh coconut, were available. It was such a good meal that we returned again to Ah Hoi‚Äôs Kitchen for lunch the next day to try what was said to be their most popular dish, the seafood Guay Tieo with wide noodles. It tasted good with the Hong Kong kailan, but it did not compare with the pork ribs that we had the night before. We did not feel that the restaurant was hot, even in the middle of the day. The venue and hotel quality service were well worth the price, and we recommend Ah Hoi‚Äôs Kitchen to those who would like to enjoy local food in more elegant yet informal surroundings.",5.0

They have a room available for approximately 18 people at the back and my family took up all the seats. My relatives have had celebrated their birthdays there before with no problem with the minimum spend as we fill up the whole room ad order substantially. However, on my birthday, they were extremely hard up about reserving the room, being very strict on the $900 minimum spend, and kept pushing us to order more throughout the dinner which did not make me feel good as my parents had to fork out money for my birthday dinner. we ordered enough to feed 18 people substantially and also had 3 boxes of takeaway pizza. Yet, they forced us to reach $900 by buying vouchers from them. They also kept reminding us about the $15 cake fee. This is not the service I expected and am saddened that a place I have fond memories of did not live up to expectations when I wanted to celebrate my birthday there.

Pepperoni PIzza,"6 Greenwood Avenue Hillcrest Park Hillcrest Park, Singapore 289195 Singapore",SingaporeSuzie007,8-Nov-14,"This place has some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had - and I'm from the US so I've tried more than my share. Their standard options are nice, but they will also omit or add toppings if you ask. We change the fancy 4 cheese pizza into a one cheese wonder (mozzarella only) for our kids all the time - and it's great! They have a really hot pizza oven that can get a pie to your table in under 10 minutes, which is great when you are there with kids or aren't sure how much to order. No worries - start with what you like and see if there's room for more because the wait won't be too long! We've only ever eaten outside, but the tables are comfy and the view is Ok - and I don't worry so much about the kids making a mess, so it works for us. I really like this place because it's so kid-friendly. The wait staff is tolerant and very accommodating. The prices are very reasonable. We've tried some other menu items and haven't been bowled over - pizza is clearly their forte. I do look forward to trying their salads though. They also offer take-away for those with a car. I also like that they offer 'happy hour' with discounted beverages during slow hours (even on soft drinks!). This is one of our favorite stand-by's in the neighborhood, and I'm sure will become a staple in our house. ",4.0

So I gave it a shot while searching for some place to have a late dinner and drinks. Overall, my experience was ok. Food was decent (shrimp fritters & Barramundi), service ok and the atmosphere nice with a lovely river view and some live music from the neighbouring places. Prices are on the high side though, but I guess that applies for pretty much all the places in that area. I would probably not have eaten the more fancy food like Lobster in Freemantle but for a fish & chips type of food with drinks it's good enough.",3.0

The steamed prawns (i think its Cantonese style) looked plain and it was surprisingly very satisfying. Also ordered the sambel stingray which was both sweet and spicy if that's your thing.

Ordered 2 x fish and chips and drinks and were charged for 2 lots. Queried bill and told they not on 1 for 1. Strange as the board was the same as before. My husband had a stand up argument at the board stating if the board hasn't changed how can the offer not apply. As he was making a scene the guy said he wasn't arguing and changed the bill.

Going rate in Singapore is $15-19 for margaritas of slightly varying sizes. These are $16.9 (.9? Really?). We started with frozen margaritas and couldn‚Äôt tell if they mistakenly left out the alcohol completely. For the next round we tried ‚Äúon the rocks‚Äù. It was all ice with a little margarita, which completely diluted when, shockingly, the ice melted sitting outside in the Singapore heat. Final round we asked for less ice, and got what amounted to a shot of margarita (see for yourself how it came to the table in the attached pic). Would you pay $16.9 for that? Very disappointing, but we should have known after seeing reviews indicating waitresses are giving free drinks for customers to write reviews. Any restaurant that engages in free stuff for reviews obviously needs to do that for some reason. The food was good so that raised it from one star.

Thai Express,"Temasek Boulevard, Singapore Singapore",gn123,16-Jan-16,"I recently visited this restaurant in Temasek Boulevard area for lunch and from the time I entered the place I was getting a feeling that something was missing in there. I was looking for someone in the restaurant who can show me the place where I could sit, not that there was no place or it was busy, there was plenty of space and it was not busy at all, but just that its courteous to be that way for someone from the staff who could guide the customer to where they can sit. So after waiting for a few minutes I waived at someone in the restaurant who seemed to be the staff and requested for a place where I could sit. I browsed through the menu and ordered my food and the server placed the food on my table and just left without even asking if I needed anything else. I had to ask for the thai chili sauce and other condiments. Thai hospitality missing big time! Its a full service restaurant and I would definitely not expect it to be of that low service. This restaurant needs to change the name of the place, its not Thai at all, else please improve the service.

Thai Express,"Temasek Boulevard, Singapore Singapore",DanielOon,1-Sep-15,"Lunch with my spouse & the Heartland Mall venue was empty (giving me a sceptic suspicion of regrets later). Menu looks good with a good spread of dishes. Food came in quick, in just 10 mins. Thus far, we were hapoy until we bite into the dishes, they were bland & tasteless. The Seafood Tom Yum had a few shrimps but they were tasteless, high likelihood of frozen ones & not fresh at all. Hence, there's no flavor at all. So were the squids & fish fillet, seriously pathetic for the 'not-so-cheap' price charged to customers. Diners dont mind paying if the quality & quantity are justifiable. Even the spices were insufficient, could only see lemon grass, nothing more. There's no fragrance of a basic authentic Tom Yum, & no taste. It's like drinking clear sour water, that's about it. Management should seriously look into such matters as it completely destroys the image of Thai's good dishes especially Thai's iconic & signature dish Tom Yum. Frankly, the Tom Yum was hopeless & it's embarassing to serve such quality to customers. I reckon i could cook 10 times better than Thai Express. Next, was another iconic Thai dish ie the Pad Thai, was another disservice to its name. Most Pad Thai we had in Singapore Thai eateries, we could smell the fragrance from afar (like Penang Char Koay Teow) before reaching out table but not with this one. Again, the shrimps didnt look fresh at all & so were the peanuts. It's so ironic & unusual that we had Pad Thai but without the fragrance, how is that possible? We had the chendol with jackfruit & to out horror the jackfruit was soggy, easily broken & not fresh at all, 100% must be canned ones. Oh yes, tasteless!! We're shock how management could allow such a simple dessert could be prepared & served to customers in such manner? Perhaps, the management find this quality 'excellent' in their eyes & taste buds. This is seriously profiteering in the expense of innocent & genuine customers. We had the Roast Chicken as our starter but when it came, it didnt look similar to what's in the menu picture which has crispy skin. All in all, it was a horrible set-back & our confidence & trust on the branding instantly went into the drains. We used to patronise this branch 7 years ago & it was good, good in every way. Good in taste, good in service, good in ambience & price is reasonable to the food quality but today, it's disastrous & horrendous. No wonder, this outlet is always empty every time i bypassed when shopping in Heartland Mall. The last disgusting pointer was the Chinese speaking kitchen staff, a chubby guy, who kept repeatedly beating the counter so loudly that he was oblivious to disturbing the ambience of diners. When I told him to stop this disturbing rhythmic noise, he denied & acted as though what's wrong with his noise making. The only saving grace to our meal was the supervisor, a pleasant & efficient Malay guy. He deserved all praises. Would i return, a big fat NO WAY. Would i recommend to someone else, obviously a big NO. Food was lousy, tasteless & unfragrant. Ingredients were not fresh & inadequate. Price dont match the food quality. Unless management rise up to the occasion to change & improve, this outlet may wind up very soon.",2.0

After a few minutes, we we taken to our table. I would say, the tables are tiny. Atmosphere wise, not for one to expect in a Thai restaurant. Music was kinda loud (for me). I had the tom yum seafood stick noodles. It was plain and boring! Just soup, stick noodles, straw mushroom, few sprig of corianders, prawns and fish. Prawns tasted not pretty fresh, which might had been frozen ( which i presume it was ). However, it was underspiced, I've been to Thailand pretty much times to know how should a beautiful bowl of Tom Yum soup taste like. It wasnt sour enough. Fish clouded the soup too. It wasn't ""Clear Tom Yum"". The worst thing about it was that the soup was lukewarm, not hot! I'm disappointed. Had prawn toast as a side dish. Sweet chili sauce that comes with it was great. However the prawn toast are underseasoned. Maybe a pinch or two of salt helps. Too much oil soaked too. Overall not good. My friend ordered the honey chicken rice.

But certainly it doesn't rate above a number of briyani places I've tried in little India. Certainly it can't rival those divine ones I've had in India.

The menu isn't huge but covers most tastes from simple wraps, burgers and salads to breakfasts. Their cake selection looks yummy but I desisted through pure willpower.

Brunetti,"163 Tanglin Road Tanglin Mall #01-35 Tanglin Mall, Singapore 247933 Singapore",xd_nat_t,9-Aug-17,"Thanks to chope reservation, I managed to enjoy a 1-for-1 deal on the pasta/risotto that's valid throughout the entire month of August! Service wasn't that efficient though with the surprisingly huge crowd on a Monday afternoon. Apparently there's no service charge here and orders are done manually at the counter, much to my surprise for this seemingly high-class restaurant. Nevertheless, I am glad this was the case as it would help me to save up on the extra expenses :P I ordered the black truffle mushroom risotto and gnocchi endamame hazelnut pesto pasta, both of which were satisfying, fulfilling and enjoyable. I personally prefer the mushroom risotto that comes with a light, creamy sauce and generous amount of mushrooms, a chewy and juicy mouthfeel with a pleasant earthy note. The truffle flavour was distinct and aromatic as well. On the other hand, the gnocchi comes with a pesto sauce that was creamy, thick and flavourful but a tad heavy and oily on the palate. The gnocchi was chewy and mochi-like, served with endamame beans and a little melted mozzarella cheese that was thick and gooey. We also tried the waffle and triple scoop gelato for desserts. Feel free to sample the gelato prior to your order, which I did and the samples were given in a generous amount too! The gelato flavours that I had were: salted butter caramel (my favourite), yogurt and dark chocolate on a belgian waffle served with butterscotch sauce. Texture of the gelato was smooth, creamy and melt-in-the mouth kind that I adore. Really love the gelato here though the waffles were just a run-off-the-mill, lacking crispness and fragrance in the batter. ",4.0

Do not eat here, the service is terrible. After 30mins there was no sign of the food so we asked a waitress who said there was a bit of a wait. So we waited and then asked again. This time we were told there was a lot of food to be cooked and there was only 2 chefs. Then she came back again and said they were starting out food now. But this was an hour after we had ordered and we didn't want to eat there anymore or give them our money. So we decided to leave. When we went to pay for our drinks they didn't even apologise or say anything at all, just went to the kitchen to cancel our order. So glad we didn't give them our money!! ",1.0

She had to go to the bar tender to find out what was it, later she comes back to me saying we are sorry but we do not have cha cha cha, what she meant was cachaca, which is the liquor from which the caipirihna is made. So I asked for rums, she did not know which types of rum they had, she went and asked the bar tender again and when I asked for a rum that was on the menu, she comes back to me and says we are sorry but we do not have. So I decided to try a rum that she said they had, it was not on the menu and she did not have a clue of how much was that drink. So I asked for a Harry's Burger, what they brought me was horrible, simply I am going to put it this way, a Burger King whopper is much more tastier and has a better quality than this burger. I would suggest that if the owners of this place read this review, you should definitely close this place and look for other business. I let the waiter know that the burger was not good, and she said she was going to tell the chef, at the end there was not even an apology for the bad burger, I ended up paying 40 dollars for a very bad meal and poor customer service.

I didn't regret it - at all. There were two fixed menus, and I chose the ""Gastronomic"" option: nine separate courses between ""Snacks"" (more usually described as amuse bouche) and two separate desserts. Each was absolutely delicious, well thought-out, and beautifully served. The portion sizes were just right: large enough to taste properly, but sufficiently small as to allow consumption of all nine without feeling - er, stuffed. The combinations were unique - to me, at least, e.g. a dish of forest mushrooms with matsutake, abalone and a mangalica pork ""veil"". I hate to focus on one dish, when all were so good, but the Snacks that got the ball rolling were exceptional, and themed on well-known Singapore favourites, such as Roti John, the likes of which you will never have tasted elsewhere.

I'm not usually a fan of uber-fancy fine dining in restaurants where the dining area feels like a sanctum sanctorum. But Iggy's makes the cut in my book. It is sleek without being pretentious. It offers only set menus - pricey of course. We went for the smallest, a three-course meal (with amuses bouches to start and dainties with coffee to finish). The food was outstanding. Our starter was an arrangement of gazpacho-ish soup with scallops, mackerel, sea urchin and ever-so-slight slices of fresh kobe (or maybe kyoto) vegetables. It sounds larger than it was - the portion was perfect and it was a feast for eyes and palate. I had fish after that - can't remember the name but beautifully cooked with a crispy skin and again a delicate arrangement of veggies. Husband and daughter had drool-worthy wagyu beef. Portions were small and we didn't want to leave hungry so I asked if we could add on anything a la carte (not on the menu). The waiter suggested a small serving of cappellini with tiny prawns. Fabulous and, shared by three, a perfect portion each. Dessert was a work of art. Sometimes culinary works of art are all form and no substance. This one was both - an assemblage of a gold chocolate ball surrounded by beautiful bits and pieces - crystallised ginger, chocolate flakes coated in gold, hazelnuts, chocolate soil (i guess). and as the waiter poured caramel sauce onto the golden ball, it opened to reveal the pear sorbet inside. gimmicky some might say - i found it endearing. even more endearing - we should've been chocolated out by now - was the sweetest, both literally and figuratively, complimentary birthday treat i've ever had at a restaurant - a small chocolate egg, that i was told, earnestly, represented new life, and that i had to smash with a ribbon-bedecked large spoon. this too (like the gold ball) had a delight inside, coconut sorbet. iggy's is a delight and the lovely tina, our hostess, and the wait staff made it the more delightful. the room we dined in (the main room) does feel like a sanctum sanctorum - no windows, low lighting, situated at the end of a long corridor. i normally like windows in restaurants but the meal here was so good i forgot about the windowlessness of it.",5.0

Iggy's,"581 Orchard Road Hilton International Singapore The Hilton Hotel, Singapore 238883 Singapore",CarolT_SG,4-Jul-15,"I was there in July with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary and his birthday. We had a good experience the last time and thought of revisiting it again. Iggy's serve a fixed set menu (veggie, 5-course, 8-course similar to the 5 but you do not need to choose between options) that is regularly updated and you have the choice of changing some of the dishes if you have food restrictions. We went for the 5-course at $235+++ as the 8-course was a little too much for us. The food was good, interesting blend of flavors and creatively presented. There was a crispy potato shaped like a stone amongst a tray of real stones, served with truffle mayo. Wagyu beef with strips of white asparagus was quite delicious. Dessert was a dish of red berries scattered with bits of red cake and silver leaf flakes. We got a plate with a chocolate bar wishing us a happy anniversary which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and attentive. However, there was nothing to give it the extra edge. The meal was like what you'd get at any other fine-dining establishment. I couldn't think of anything memorable to rave about other than the bill that came up to over $700 for two (set meals, wine, water). Would I go back again? Perhaps, but I wouldn't be overly excited to do so.",4.0

There wasn't much of a menu to choose from as only the degustation set (with its vegetarian alternative) was available. Food served was surprisingly nicely presented and the ingredients used were indeed fresh and flavorful. One of the dishes was even served with the broth hot and bubbly right to your table. Dishes were properly introduced and well paced. The ambient noise went up once the room filled up but within tolerable limits. Portions might not be big, but the number of dishes made up for it. We ordered a glass of rose wine which we thought went well with the mix of red and white meats. The Japanese touch to the meal was refreshing. A dessert wine to accompany the desserts would be recommended. Overall a nice culinary experience although the price is definitely on the high side ~S300 per person.

Iggy's,"581 Orchard Road Hilton International Singapore The Hilton Hotel, Singapore 238883 Singapore",tropicalnorth,17-Jan-15,"Have hemmed and hawed about trying this expensive restaurant ""best in Singapore"" b/c of the poor reviews. It's a lot of money to put down to be hungry or disappointed, however my partner was keen on trying it so I made reservations that night for 2. It's located in the Hilton Hotel on Orchard which was undergoing renovations and also had a loud party with DJ going on the same level. However no noise could be heard inside the restaurant proper. There is a bar service room where people are seated at a bar but we were in another room further back. It's a sparse room with white tablecloths on tables and we were seated on leather parson-type chairs. There were the black plastic swivel chairs people complained about at other tables. Service was prompt, efficient without being suffocating. The room was manned by about 5 servers and they did an excellent job of keeping water/wine filled and cutlery available. They only serve a Gastronomie menu (veg or not) and so we ordered that and my partner had wine accompaniment. They don't do a formal wine pairing but instead charge you by the glass ($36) for the wines. The menu changes seasonally so I won't describe it in detail. They start you off with snacks and chips/bread sticks which I enjoyed. My partner didn't enjoy the curry fried anchovies as much as I did. I thought the snacks had interesting flavours and set a tone of what was to come. Three types of bread (with refill) were offered: peanut, cheese and almond. I found the almond dry and crusty (better with butter) and liked the cheese and peanut ones much more. We had a quail meatball cooked en papillote (plastic) with truffles which did not have much scent or flavour. My partner had the lamb and I had the wagyu beef which were good (I much preferred the Japanese wagyu to the Australian and it seemed a pity to serve both when the Japanese is so much better) They had a palate cleanser of gin/tonic and banana ice cream which I loved followed by an unlimited chocolate plate. I'm assuming they think you will be too full to demolish the tray but I managed to sample one of everything (for review purposes of course) The handmade chocolates were well done with the yuzu being a particular favourite. The jelly, marshmallow and chocolate truffle were pretty standard. Macarons (which Eric Ripert got me addicted to) were well crafted with a nice crust and soft innards however only 2 flavours really stood out: salted caramel (I think?) and black truffle. I have to admit the black truffle didn't immediately win me over, but the flavour profile was so true that I found myself warming up to it. This was the case with a few dishes we had. The toro/otoro was plated on cooked onions (I don't love onions) and initially ate it separately but gave it another try and ended up enjoying the combination more than toro separately. Of the wines, the chardonnay initially paired up well with the quail meatball bringing out the butteriness of the chardonnay but otherwise the wines were pretty standard - my partner wasn't enthused. They served champagne with the snacks and no dessert wine so 4 glasses total. Iggy was in the restaurant and spent a lot of time with a table of 4 beside us as well as 2 other tables in the room but didn't come by our table. I guess he's busy but it does seem like a snub to visit 3/5 tables. Bathroom is outside the restaurant and is typical for a mid-level hotel. Because of the party going on, it was a bit more awkward than for a usual night. There were 3 ladies hanging out when I visited. Coffee/tea is also not included in the price of the meal. Total cost for 2 people with only one drinking wine: $800. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. I'm not sure why there were poor reviews. Everything tasted fresh and was well cooked but the flavours were subtle. We were both quite full at the end of the meal. However there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about the meal which makes me want to return. If you're planning a special night out or want to impress guests, then this is a safe bet but in terms of being one of the best restaurants in the world - I don't think so.",4.0

Similar to great arthouse cinema, everything overwhelms and it's only days and weeks later that you truly begin to appreciate (both good and bad) all of the aspects of the experience.

The entrance corridor is the highlight of the experience. The dining room lacks any kind of atmosphere with oddly mismatched decor. Robots would have more personality than the staff, portions are small and with food going back no one thought to ask if it was ok? They are trying to be simple and creative letting the ingredients speak for themselves with the flavour combinations being the interest factor. Unfortunately the ingredients were not great quality the tomatoes in the first course lacked any flavour I think hydroponicaly grown tomatoes from cold storage have as much flavour.

We were spending one night in Singapore after a Seabourn cruise. I had asked a business colleague based in Singapore to recommend some of the ""hot"" restaurants there. We chose Iggy's for no other reason than it was very close to the hotel at which we were staying overnight. I have to say it was one of my most disappointing dining experiences ever. While the restaurant delivers on atmosphere and interior design (very unique), the service was only satisfactory (efficient, but lacked warmth). I truly cannot find the proper adjective to describe the food...abismal just does not cut it. I consider myself to be a ""foodie"", but this restaurant, to put it bluntly, is simply a rip-off. The menu was somewhat imaginative, but the food was tasteless. The prices are equal to some of the finest Michelin 3-star european or New York City restaurants, but the food is far from worthy.

Forget the setting, forget the service, forget the alcohol. You're palette is here for an adventure! (just kidding, I'll talk about those later). After tasting the first 3 dishes of our degustation, it became a habit for me to look at the menu every 2 minutes!!! It was like new year's eve. You're waiting for something great, but the waiting just gets to you. Take note that the interval between dishes is around 10-15 minutes. Moreover, there was like 13-14 dishes on the list including dessert. To be honest, there was nothing much to complain about the service. Unless you put into consideration that IT IS a Michelin star restaurant, then you could say it COULD have been better. The alcohol list was adequate enough and the setting was just right (Dim lights, quiet, intimate and cozy type of set up). The private room was also good since it provided some form of privacy. The room was designed to make it partially hidden from from the outside- Just how i like it when eating with family or friends. A word of warning for steak lovers, the wagyu they serve here is not as fat as you would think.

Iggy's on the 14th February celebrated with a Valentine's Day Menu and at $275++ per person it didn't come cheap : we were expecting fireworks! The tasting menu consisted of a myriad of beautifully presented, small plates of fusion food, most of them worked while some lacked that punch of original flavour that we were expecting from the melding of East & West ingredients. The menu commenced with 5 different 'snack' plates : Wakasagi, lemon looked and tasted like a deep fried whitebait and having waited over 40 minutes for our first bite - and one bite it was - we were a little underwhelmed. The next 3 pieces, Akami, myoga : Chutoro, chrysanthemum & Buri, sesame arrived on one plate : they looked like sushi but the rice had been replaced by 3 flavoured melting meringues .. they were a taste and feel sensation - fabulous to look at and fabulous to eat. Eel, passion fruit (tasteless) was next followed by Wagu tatare (under seasoned) on a Sarawak black pepper crisp (very tasty) and ending with a slither of Fribourg Vacherin which swallowed up the black truffle which came with it and seemed rather pointless. Then came the real plates : Gillardeau oysters with sago pearls,balsamic jelly & sea salad was pretty and pleasant. A slice of superb foie was balanced on a slice of tofu (with some greens and a sherry sauce) : this to me was complete confusion 2 preparations from opposite ends of the food spectrum balanced on top of each other ended up looking and feeling the same while the blandness of the tofu stole the taste sensation and pure pleasure of foie gras we carnivores crave! Abalone, artichoke,pistachio & yuzu kosho worked for my partner but I found the abalone chewy. Salmon with cabbage, pickled cucumber & kimchi was wonderfully colourful and tasty : the sous-vide fish retained the maximum flavour and melted on the tongue. Pigeon, rose, berries & seeds was enjoyable but the extra flavours didn't stand out. Onto desserts .... Flowers, yoghurt, lychee, lime was fine. Chocolate, nutmeg and hazelnut worked except for the dry mini slice of nutmeg cake - a moist dark gingerbread would have worked better. The service was professional but exceedingly slow so much so that, apart from our pre-dinner drinks, in the almost 4 hour meal we had to consume two bottles of wine and copious amounts of water! Needless to say the wine list is amazing; Ignatius Chan, the owner and a well known sommelier knows his stuff. Iggy's in consistantly in the top 50 Best Restaurants in the World which I find difficult to comprehend as, while being interesting, the food missed that WOW factor that other successful molecular restaurants hit. The new venue, designed by Chris Lee was odd and while there was abundant interesting artwork most tables in the room we were in were pointed at a wall with glass doors which periodically opened to reveal the kitchen - that would be fine but as soon as you got interested in what was going on beyond the doors shut again ... it was a 'floorshow' that became really annoying! Overhead music, never a good idea, was slightly too loud and obtrusive and it was altogether TOO COLD! Would I rush back - maybe - but with most of the dishes consisting of tireless mise en place, sous vide dishes and little final preparation I would expect the kitchen to pick up the pace slightly; AND with our bill hitting $1,200+ I would hope the expense account would pick up the next tab!",4.0

Wrong! It was quite small (maybe 200grams) and advertised as rib eye but looked more like sirloin and my medium-rare was cooked medium-well which made it as chewy as an old boot! The waitress didn't even ask why I only ate a third of my meal so maybe she's used to seeing that happen. Maybe I was expecting too much after all the brand is renown for its buffalo wings not steaks. But my wife ordered the mixed grill which wasn't much better. The prawns were OK but you can't trick her when it comes to marinating and cooking on a bbq. The chicken thigh wasn't a slow cooked job, it had been boiled in the marinade and then just finished on a grill to get the bbq look. Least that's our opinion without checking the kitchen.

Hooters,"Blk 3D River Valley Road #01-03 Shophouse Row, Clarke Quay, Singapore 179023 Singapore",Seaside813786,9-Sep-18,"Had to post this here because they keep deleting my google review. This franchise is so cheap it's embarrassing. Curly fries are $5.90. Curly fries with cheese is $6.90. That's a $1 difference. When you ask for a top-up of cheese sauce, they charge you $2.30... completely irrational, moronic and greedy. The measly amount they give you will only last you half of the fries. You could get away with a $1 top up even though that's still ridiculous. It would make more sense to STATE ON THE MENU the cheese sauce top-ups are $1 and then give it to the customers for free as it would not cost the establishment a dime in the long run, so that you would secure guaranteed revisits and positive word of mouth. This isn't about cheese sauce, it's about management and morale. This place even forces you to buy bottled water even though Singapore has drinkable tap water. The food is average. The waitresses are friendly but the service feels inconsistent. It's clear this franchise survives only on the Hooters brand name and the location. I'll personally buy the franchise owner an F&B management course and throw in a free math lesson. Now that's generous.",2.0

When we entered there we were ushered in politely and the manager at the front desk asked us what we wanted. We duly showed him our coupons and told him that we would like to redeem the Chicken Biryanis. The minute we said that, the manager's tone changed and he became extremely hostile. He rudely told us that he cannot permit us to use the coupons as they can be used as one coupon per table. We agreed to that and one of us ate first, while the rest of us went shopping to return later. We returned later and once again the manager in a rude, loud voice (now practically yelling at us) told us that we will have to sit separately. Again we agreed to it (it was just two of us at this point). Then the manager suddenly changed his statement and started humiliating us very loudly.

The food was okay but the lamb curry had huge muttony chunks that had not been simmered long enough to turn them into succulent morsels.

Therefore I proudly introduced my friend who just returned from overseas to this restaurant. The Pomelo Salad is still great but the Tom Yung Kung (Tiger prawns in spicy lemon grass and lime soup) is not spicy enough this time! Definitely not up to par with those I have tried elsewhere. The Kao Phad Sapparod (Pineapple Fried Rice) is not fragrant and the Tord Mun Kung (Deep Fried Shrimp Cakes) which I think is one of their speciality is nothing to shout about. As my friend was unwilling to pay 50c for a glass of water, we ordered a glass of hot lemongrass to share. For $6.50 a glass, the lemongrass fragrance is definitely lacking and I felt that they shouldn't stinge on the amount of lemongrass they used! Sure they have an extensive menu and I haven't tried all their stuff, so I can't say this restaurant is not worth visiting again! Service is not too bad as usual.

I even double checked with the waiter prior to ordering and was assured that it's only a spoonful of curry as sauce. The chef overdid it and was again too salty. Can't finish. My mango sticky rice did not work for me, despited waited for 20 mins! The dessert was weird as the mango was too sourish and not the typical sweet aromatic mango you normal take in Thai restaurant! Another dish that was left unfinished! I've been to Nara in Bangkok and was very impressed. Can't say the same for this particular branch! Customer service was also bad here.

Nara Thai Singapore,"2 Orchard Turn Ion Orchard Ste #B3-21, Singapore 238801 Singapore",Ophir77,30-May-17,"We rarely visit ION Orchard as it is such a busy place but we made special effort to dine at Nara Thai restaurant as I and my colleagues have catered from them a number of times. We did not feel much of an ambience when we arrived and were shown to the table. The service was not very welcoming and when my husband and I sat side by side rather than across each other, no effort was made to shift the placemat, cutlery and the menu to where I was seated. No drinks were offered and I had to ask for water twice. We were disappointed to learn that the chicken served were all from frozen meat and only dark meat; none of the chicken dishes offered breast meat like what we so enjoyed in Thailand. One of the wait staff was particularly sour-faced. I asked very politely for some nam pla (I have used the Thai word for fish sauce from my Thai recipe books since the 80s) and when she did not understand I said fish sauce and she replied curtly 'I do not speak Thai'. I felt the remark was most unnecessary as I only used one word. A better response from a service staff interested in being friendly to a customer would be, 'Oh I am not familiar with that word but I learnt something today'. The Thai fish cakes we ordered were delicious as we remembered from our catering. The Massaman Beef Curry was very tasty, the meat nice and tender although a bit oily. The crab omelette was alright but did not have crab flakes on the top as showing in the menu. We also each ordered a set dish that came with rice, chopped chicken with basil, a fried egg and a few cucumber slices. The waiter said he could change the white rice to the (bluish) butterly pea rice (which I always order when catering) and we appreciated that he was thoughtful and flexible only to find out later that we were charged additional $2 each for the change. We told him he should have mentioned and checked if we wanted to pay extra as we would have not since white rice costs $1.90 and butterfly pea rice $2.50. We should have only been charged at most the difference of 60 cents!! It is not the amount so much as the principle behind it. We also noted that one of the other waiters was extra pleasant to a European customer and addressed him as 'Sir' which was different from the service we received. Overall, as much as we would like to have the Massaman curry again and try some of the other interesting dishes, I doubt if we would return at least not for a while. The meal cost $102 for the two of us with only tap water to drink (charged $1 each) so a bit pricey for us. I guess for a quick set lunch where you have no time to pay attention much to service but just have time to eat and rush, the set lunches seem a good option.",3.0

In addition to the regular dishes, we ordered kids meal and it comes with an ice cream for dessert. But although we have reminded the waitresses twice to bring the ice cream, it took almost 10 minutes till they brought it out (I mean how long does it really take to scoop an ice cream and sprinkle a few chocolate on top of it?). We dined around 2pm and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. And when we asked the waitresses about our food, their faces didn't seem very nice. I wasn't alone to notice the waitresses' response but so did my wife. No wonder they're no longer rated as one of the best. ",2.0

I like my usual Thai Olive Rice and the Chicken Wings stuffed with Minced Pork but to my disappointment, both of these items are unavailable in Nara. We requested for the Prawn Tom Yum Kung to be changed to Seafood Tom Yum Kung as we preferred to hv a mixture of seafood. The soup is good although not better than others served elsewhere but what is really yummy is the Yum Som O (pomela salad). I would have loved to have double portions of this as it's so appetising and much better than a lot of Thai Mango Salad. The next item is one that I have never tasted in a Thai restaurant before-it's the Kao Phad An Chan (butterfly pea fried rice $2.50). I don't know if this is an authentic Thai dish but I would definitely come back for this dish alone. We also ordered the Hors d'oeuvre Nara-Assorted Nara's Hors d'oeuvre at $17.90 featuring BBQ pork w Tamarind dip, Thai fish cakes, Pandan chicken and a small pomelo salad. This dish gives one the chance to try an assortment of Thai dishes but I find them all unremarkable.

The drinks selection was pretty alright (two kinds of beers, two kinds of cocktails) , although when I wanted to order one of their two cocktails, they told me that they ran out of the rose syrup that they use to make it, so I got their other cocktail, the siamese sour, which became a little cloying after a few sips. I would rather have gone for their iced tea since their bar wasn't very big. For the food, I got their Gai Pak Panang (spicy barbequed chicken), which was rather tough and dry, but had a tasty marinade; and their Kuay Tiew Tom Yum Kung (Tom Yum noodles with prawns), which was pretty alright - nothing too special, although the prawns were delightfully crunchy and juicy. The service wasn't too bad, although it could have been better considering there were only 4 to 5 other tables when I walked in, and the counter and other floor staff were simply standing around chatting and joking around with each other.

The shrimp paste fried rice cost $13.90++ and so would be the free dish for the 1-1. Ok granted its free but you can see from the picture I attached it was pathetic! At first I had expected shrimp paste aside but was told its fried with the rice that's why its called shrimp paste fried rice......so lame. It was so bland and tasteless and can you imagine no egg with fried rice? Anybody would had thought egg is basic ingredient in any fried rice but not here, not to mention I was misled by their photo clearly showing fried egg with the rice. Last but not least the measly few tiny pieces of chicken with the dish clearly shows the restaurant has no qualm in serving such poor qualit food and charging $13.90++ for it If I had to pay usual price?

Most of the tapas are only snack size and around $12 - $15.00 The drinks arrived promptly, but there was a long wait until the food arrived, and it was difficult to "" flag down "" a waiter / waitress to get a second drink. I tried the Bruschettas, nice flavours but small portions mean you need to order more food or desserts. Overall food and drinks were acceptable, service slow but staff were very busy with most tables full. But brilliant location/ setting makes it ok.",3.0

Just a tiny plate with a dozen anchovies deeply submerged in oil and vinegar. Then we ordered the a portion if grilled bread separately to try and mop it down easier. Bread was hardly grilled at all. Looked more like heated quickly a very light and fast grilling. Flaky bread too. Didn't taste much like bread at all. Also had the grilled octopus. It was rubbery. Tasted like it it had been overcooked and it didn't have much favour. Even Australian Fremantle pickled octopus has 10 times more flavour. The grilled was the dish that was ok.

No Signboard Seafood,"1 Harbourfront #03-02 Vivocity, Singapore 098585 Singapore",luvirin,14-Oct-16,"This place used to be our family's spot when we have craving for crab. I've tried chilli crab in Bamboo seafood, Red House and No Signboard, still find No Signboard the best. Not yet tried the Geilang outlet though. This outlet has nice ambiance with superb white pepper crab. The taste is just perfect. If you order chilli crab please remember to include their fried bun. It's the best among all the 3 crab houses I've been, crispy outside, soft inside and doesn't have much grease feeling. Now we talk about the less endearing sides. Looks like from the end of 2015, they seem never to have Sri Lanka crab (which is super nice and about 60S$/kg), so you always have to choose either Scotland or the other type (can't remember name), you end up paying 120S$/kg, i.e double vs before, and only one thing I'm sure is the taste isn't two times better. The other thing makes them really have to thank God that they still survive till now is the crappy service attitude. It's also among the reasons we haven't visited them nowadays. The waitresses, I still remember one quite old and the other maybe at her 30-40, have the face of cold blood assasinates whenever giving you dishes. Just forget to expect them to smile. If you're lucky enough to have them assigned to your table, you'll find they manage to ignore you almost of the time in need, even when they just idly walk around. They talk to you like you're begging something, rough and rude. And just when you think ""she may have a bad day"" to excuse for that attitude, you hear her laughing loudly and joking with colleagues next to your table, and still not forget to ignore you as much as possible. It was what happened to me. After the 2nd time going there and getting them assigned to our table, we had to ask to change waitress whenever we see them coming. On the contrary, this outlet has a young and very nice lady who normally arranges table for customers, only sometimes I see her taking orders. So put the price aside, it's your luck or you have to change the waitress to enjoy your meal.",3.0

No Signboard Seafood,"1 Harbourfront #03-02 Vivocity, Singapore 098585 Singapore",Jeremiah L,23-Aug-16,"No Signboard is an iconic chilli crab destination in Singapore. It has a relatively long history, beginning in the 1970's. Its claim to fame includes their signature dish, white pepper crab (as opposed to the more commonly used black pepper). I have only ever had their chilli crabs and first fell in love with them at their original Geylang branch. The Geylang branch still looks like it did 20 years ago and recaptures the spirit and charm of the early 1990. Recently, I had friends over from Australia and thought it might be a great idea to take them to the vivocity branch to experience thi unique;y Singaporean dish. I must say, the Vivoity branch was wayyy over-priced. The same good food was served but somehow felt pretentious and that the service was average, not befitting of the fake classy envirnment they weretrying to create. Though my Aussie friends enjoyed the meal, i felt that we were being ripped off and I have also denied them of an authentic experience. I would recommend this venue/branch only if you are a tourist who is really strapped for time, staying close to Sentosa and have only 1 oportunity to try Singapore style Chilli Crab. Otherwise, the Geylang branch would still be the one to go for the full authentic experience.. MAJOR POINT FOR CONSIDERATION before going to Vivocity: Chilli crabs goes BEST with Sri Lankan Mud Crabs which is was what the original dish was create with. Going by the reviews, you might not be able to get these crabs at this branch (when i was there, they said Sri Lankan was not available and they pushed the Canadian Dungeness crabs to us instead..which i felt goes better with Cajun insteadof Chilli crab). This puts the authenticity of this branch's Chilli crab into question. Lastly, we ordered 2 small crabs for a table of 5, which was enough. The crabs alone cost us $200, which was fine.. but in addition we ordered rice and some vegetables and 1 plate of chicken - the bill came up to $400+. I felt ripped off paying $200+ for wok stir fry dishes or what the locals term 'Zi Char', which would normally cost less than $80 elsewhere.",3.0

We also ordered Kang Koong Sambal and it was quite good (even though pricey also, $15 for small size). When the chilli crab arrived, I felt that the sauce was not very good, they put too much eggs in the sauce, all I taste in the sauce is only the eggs.

The usual green tea is served throughout the meal and the perfect little coconut and mango desserts to finish are divine. For those who want wine, there is an extensive wine list and even those at the bottom end are excellent. This is certainly a place to take guests if you want to impress.",4.0

Imperial Treasure Cantonese Cuisine,"1 Kim Seng Promenade Great World City Floor 02 Unit 111 112, Singapore 237994 Singapore",222jits,22-Feb-18,"Experiencing a company ‚ÄòLo Hei‚Äô lunch (Chinese new year celebration meal) was a great way to sample of a lot of dishes in one sitting (eight to be precise). We started with a roast duck dish which had a crispy skin and a lovely juicy texture to the meat. That was swiftly followed by a steamed fish lightly cooked in soy sauce. Next was a long bean and stir fry dish that was also tasty in a delicate way and not too strong. The next dish I skipped as it was a shark‚Äôs fun soup, so it was a little disappointing personally to hear they served that, but as many people still order the dish at this festive time, it‚Äôs something that still appears on the menu. I‚Äôm not sure if my appetite was spoiled after that but the following dishes felt a bit underwhelming. They included a vegetable and sea cucumber dish in a heavy sauce that seemed to smother the flavour. The carbs came in the form of glutinous rice which also seemed heavy and overly oily. The desert was a red bean soup that tasted a little bland and was unfortunately a downer for the end of the meal. Overall the meal was nice without being great and the service was similarly efficient without being memorable. Hopefully they can ditch the shark‚Äôs fin from the menu and I would be inclined to return, otherwise I‚Äôll keep my distance. ",3.0

Taste-wise, the vegetable dish is ordinary, the braised bean curd is excessively rich, while the frog legs are actually disappointing. The star of the dinner was surprisingly, the soup of the day.

We were seated outside which normally would be welcomed at a place with such beautiful views of the CBD area but yesterday was the first day that the haze was over 200. So not such a nice place to be seated. Our daughters ordered three appetizers to share as they were not terribly hungry and my husband and I each ordered a main. The table/chair combo would be great for cocktails and nibbles but the chair was very low and deep (it needed a pillow for the back) so difficult for dinner. The rooftop had metal plates which were covered with an ""astroturf"" for lack of a better word. Every time someone stepped on the metal plate that part of my chair was on my chair moved which I found very disconcerting, a bit like having someone kick your seat on an airplane. I got over it but it was an annoyance. The appetizers were tapas and beautifully presented. The hummus needed a few more of the flat crisps to eat it with and the staff brought more promptly after we asked. The bruschetta was served on stale small breads and didn't win anyone over. The meatballs were, well, only two for $12 and the worst value on the menu! Honestly, a $6 meatball??? Ridiculous. It has a garlic toast on the side, made with the same stale bread from bruschetta. We saw others order the paella which was well sized and looked wonderful. My husband had the cod curry which was lovely but smallish for $40. I had the lamb which the server did not ask how I wanted cooked (it came perfectly cooked, medium rare) and was very tasty. After we called for the check, the waiter asked to see our tickets for the opera as they offer a 10% discount for dinner if you are attending an event in the Esplanade (I had noted this in my reservation request).

I've been here many times and would very much like to keep this secret to myself but after hearing friends and relatives being ripped off by unscrupulous vendors for lousy drinks, I've decided to give this place a plug. Let's hope that Orgo will continue to live up to its quality. Firstly, from the top of the Esplanade, you get a beautiful city skyline which includes the Marina Bay Sands. (Personally, I find the other buildings including the Esplanade itself more appealing but the Marina Bay Sands is there - for those who want a good view.) Orgo has intimate seatings but the highlight for me has always been the drinks. The Singapore Sling is very different from the one served in Raffles Hotel. Their business blurb says that they serve seasonal fruit cocktails. The quality of the cocktails unfortunately does vary but it is usually between good and excellent. (to owners of orgo if you are reading this - perhaps you need to work on consistency). However, I've never had a bad cocktail here. I've never been a fan of Singapore Sling but the Singapore Sling in Orgo has changed my mind. Some of my friends have complained that they seem to be abstemious on the proportion of the alcohol for the drinks but hey, I rather have less of a good thing than more of a pipe cleaner. Their house wine is also more drinkable than other places.The tapas are decent. The meals are generally okay though not amazing. Hence I've only been here for drinks and tapas. The dessert can be disappointing so, save the space for a second drink : ",5.0

Restaurant was quiet with only another couple of tables taken, service was reasonable although you could tell that if the place was full, the speed of the service would probably drop. While the food was good, we had the sea bass, a pizza and a side of asparagus, the one thing that showed either the lack of empowerment of staff, or lack of training, was that the pizza ordered was the messicana, it comes with a few toppings including eggplant. I asked to swap the eggplant to artichoke, which had seen on other pizzas. Initially the waiter said he couldn‚Äôt do it because the pizza comes with eggplant. He said he could remove the eggplant and charge extra for the artichoke. We said that seemed a bit inflexible, especially as it wasn‚Äôt a $33 pizza. He said he would ask the manger. Duly after checking he came back and said ok they could swap it. While we both enjoyed our meal, I think the lack of flexibility, or lack of customer service based training in front of house makes it easy to see why this place has had poor reviews due to service.

We were seated indoors and, of course, it was not busy because of Covid restrictions. Service should have been excellent. However, service was atrocious. We practically had to beg for service. The waiter dropped off menus, never returned. Had to chase him down - for every single thing we ordered. Ordered wine, waiter never brought the bottle until I went outside to bar and searched for service to have it brought inside. Ordered food and it took 30 minutes to make tacos. LOL Worse, we ordered several items and they didn't arrive at all. I had to chase the Waiter for each item. It's as if the Waiter was a drone flying around without a CPU or a controller. Absolutely mindless and he acted like he didn't care at all. The cost for a low-end bottle of house wine, tacos, and a couple of deserts (had to wait 30 minutes for them to cut a piece of cold pecan pie and put it on a plate!) was almost $300. If just the service had been bad, then I might have dismissed the cost as 'life in Singapore', but at these prices alongside absolutely terrible service I'll never return.

First of all, there was some terrible live music outside in the courtyard dining area (shared by all the restaurants on the interior ring of Chijmes), so I sat inside. The best thing about the restaurant is that I really liked the plates. Nice ceramics. I ordered a margarita. It was good. I also ordered the ""Classic Green Enchiladas"", which were presented to me in a salsa SOUP. Yes, they were drenched in liquid, and sprinkled with some herbs, which I guess one is supposed to savour and let the flavours roll around and frolic in one's mouth, but for god's sake, this was a soggy tortilla, with some mildly seasoned chicken, in a soup of salsa verde.

We had the crispy fish tacos which are priced at something like $14 for the two and we struggled to find the fish. Meanwhile our drinks order didn't arrive. We had been in the restaurant about 35 minutes before our drinks arrived. At this point we were asked if we were waiting on any more food to which we informed the waitress yes and what was outstanding. Oh and by the way we were still waiting for some water we had ordered some 45 minutes beforehand. At this point there were also a number of tables surrounding us for which the patrons had left but it seemed beneath the waiting staff to clear them. So we were surrounded by at least 4 dirty tables. Finally nearly an hour in to our experience the rest of our food arrived which was stone cold. We requested to speak to the manager who apologised and offered a free dessert, which we didn't want as we hadn't really had a main course. We said our date night for the two of us which doesn't happen often had been ruined.

While the food was ok, service poor,, and the prices a bit on the expensive side, the sad part is the let down on the expectation of eating Mexican and getting something else, perhaps a Chef's creative vision. Didn't help that the staff got the order wrong on 2 out of 4 items, and the nachos never came. Not at all recommended if you want Mexican food. ",3.0

When I asked for 2 more, she looked unhappy n walked back n gave me 1. Well, to prevent any trouble, I walked in, open my boxes and poured more from the table. She stopped me halfway and said I can't do that since those are for dine in customers. I don't see any labels indicating it. And also being a frequent customer, I don't see that's a problem bec. the bowl is frequently refilled once it's empty. Before I left I asked for her name and she confidently tell me. It seems that she feel she had done nothing wrong. And clearly she isn't deaf. If u guys r trying to hard sell the chilli, I dont see why she shld do that.

She showed me the way to the seating area which i went to the opposite direction and sat where the reserved sign was on the table. Maribeth told me that its reserved and i asked her if they are expecting anymore guests and she said they will clean the table. I mentioned to her that i wont be long and she was fine with it. After 5mins the lady named DAYA told me that i was not supposed to seat there. It get into my nerves with the tone of her voice she's using was inappropriate. I told her that is there any problem with me seating there as i am comfortable in my seating area already. She said that section is close for cleaning and there is other tables which is available and she was pointing it.

It comes with a dollop of very spicy chili sauce, so be prepared and order a cool drink with your meal.

First restaurant that caught our eyes at Level 4 was Nana Thai Restaurant & Ayam Penyet Restaurant was glaring at us, just exactly one floor above. Signboard was not exactly appealing with myriads of dish posters cluttering on front facade. We searched for other restaurants eg Nanbantei, Sushi Bar, Nana Thai, etc except this eatery. Never knew this place had so many surprises, really good positive surprises. Dropped in at 1pm for lunch & restaurant was 70% full. Service was prompt & polite by the good Malay male waiters, good looking too. Despite the lunch crowd, the first few dishes arrived within 5 mins. Our first reaction when we saw the portion was ""How come so little & why so costly?"" However, the moment we sank our teeth into the Ayam Penyet, it was heavenly & awesomely delicious. The sambal was to die for, it was spicy hot, an authentic Malay styled hot. I was complaining to my family that the good sambal was not adequate for the whole plate of ingedients but the kind waiter pointed me to the self-service bowl of sambal. It was like as though the management could read my mind, so empathetic. The Avocado was fantastic. The chicken was crispy & crunchy that i even ate the bones, nothing's left on my plate. The tahu goreng were excellent, crispy on the outside & succulent inside. The tempeh were the best i've tried. The floss covering the chook were marvellous & aplenty. The kangkong were cooked to perfection & they went well with the cucumber mixed with the sambal. Then, the beef was yummy, a must have. The Soto Ayam was beautiful, i could taste the rempah & spices, just right not overwhelming. We concluded with the hot coffee to match the burning sensations on our tongues by the sambal, heavenly sensation. Another thing we like about this restaurant is you pay cash the moment you ordered anything so that when any customers finished eating, they could just leave without having to wait for cashier & creating unnecessary waiting by customers coming in. All in all, in hindside, food was superbly great, pricing was value for money, service was efficient & courteous, ambience was nothing fanciful (clean & orderly) but just right for dining. Would i return again, a resounding YES & to any of their branches. I even suggest to one of the waiters to start ine in nex shopping mall. Kudos to management & your kitchen team & waiting staff. ",5

Both dishes were served very quickly so I suppose it's just quickly reheated, thereby making the food only slightly warm and a bit too dry. Additional kremes bits are added on top of the food, but I didn't like it because it's making the already-dry-dish even drier. But we like the chili since it's very spicy!!! The rice portion is very small so I have to order extra rice, but I suppose you can't ask much with that price,  ",3

Tried as well, fish cake - took a long time to come but it was worth the wait. Its not the spicy type so warned if you were expecting the 'red' ones! Also had the beef balls smashed, not bad. Drinks i had the sparkling pink drink- not so nice. Could not taste the Bandung at all. Crackers were standard. 50$ for 4 'smashed' chicken 1 fish cake (4 pieces) , 4 Drinks, 1 Beef Ball Smashed.

It is a 'No Frill' restaurant with spacious room to accommodate perhaps 150 people or more . We were given a small order form- when we called the man who was serving other tables- he curtly told us to take the paper to the cashier. So you choose your dishes from 23 items listed on the paper, pay at the cashier and your order will be taken. We had Ayam Penyet (smashed Fried Chicken + Rice ) $ 6.90, Grilled Chicken + Rice $ 6.90, Empal Penyet ( Smashed beef steak + Rice ) $ 6.90 with Fried Fish cake for appetiser ( 6.50 ). Each main course was served on wooden plate lined with banana leaf with a small tofu and tempe, and a table spoon of very, very hot ( taste good ) chilli. Unfortunately the rice comes in a cheap plasticky plate cancelling the pretty main course presentation. Several Indonesian popular drink / dessert. Es Champur with shaved iced, syrup and fruit $ 3.50 , Lava Girl $ 2.20; mineral water $ 1.80-- unfortunately , Orange -Pineapple juice was not fresh juice- for $ 2 one can get a fresh one at Bugis st, alley. No alcohol bev. Food was tasty , meat was tender- most tables are taken- mostly Indonesians. Perhaps since it is so pupolar the management doesn't feel the need to refurbish the place to make it look like a restaurant instead of a food court. ( Mind you the waitresses/ers are wearing Batik aprons.) It is a big popular WARUNG.",3

When we told the server that we are here for the set lunch, he asked what we wanted. The set lunch offers 4-5 choices of appetizer and 7-8 main course options, so I asked to see the menu for the set lunch. To my surprise, the server said we do not have a menu and that since we had bought the set lunch, we should know what we wanted. I felt strange to even insist on getting a menu - from his body language, I felt that he was not happy as though I was making a seemingly unreasonable request. I said that you should at the very least have a print-out because the extensive menu selection is not something I would commit to memory. A printout came about 10 minutes late ",2

The buffet was predominantly seafood orientated, with a-la-carte ordering of crab dishes, and one serving per person of lobster or abalone. The buffet was an international type buffet with cheese, salad, soup, some bread, and a mixture of western and asian-based seafood dishes. There was a small carvery with beef and pork, but when they finished, there wasn't a top up. There was also Japanese sashimi and shellfish. Desserts was a mixture of local nyonya and the eponymous cakes. Coffee and teas were included in the price, and wine was surprisingly affordable (~$9 a glass). We came using a credit card offer (1 free for every 3 diners), and based on that price, it was good value.",4

It was a reunion of old friends who went on the AFS exchange programme eons ago We had good food and great reminiscing. Booking was for13 but 12 turned up. One very generous member quietly paid for all and left early...but I found out later that we were charged wrongly as one did not have the buffet. No issue...corrected. However after going home, I realised that the number charged was for 13 not 12. Through one phone call, the Asst Manager corrected it immediately and credited the difference back to my friend's credit card. This was customer service way beyond my expectations!

Today, my wife and I decided to bring my nephew out for Peranakan buffet lunch at Spices Cafe. My nephew who is handicapped with cerebral palsy since birth knows only one enjoyment - good food. Watching my diet as a personal choice, I was determined to enjoy the meal without any hangover guilt. While helping my nephew to select his food, I made a mental map of what I would take for my own consumption. The spread was reasonably good, around 10 main dishes, soup station, popiah & pie tee station, satay bee hoon & laksa station, fruit rojak, nonya kuehs, desserts, fruits, etc. Zeroing in on only a few main dishes, I also sampled small amounts of soup, laksa, popiah, desserts and fruits. Though I do not have a sweet tooth, I ended up enjoying the green bean sago durian soup and durian pengat most because they use real durian. I was glad I filled my stomach but did not have the bloated feeling of overeating. Choosing wisely what and how much I ate I had conquered the common temptation of over indulgence.

The place is neat and clean and has ample seating, the staff is extremely courteous, but service for some items can be slow. The food was average and not upto the big hype surrounding it for the Indian Non Veg Food. The Biryani rice was average, cold and is served with normal thali accompaniments. You do not get raitha or salads with the Biryani Rice. The side dishes were also not upto the mark. The waiters kept us waiting for hot water and did not serve till the end. It is an average restaurant and may have done down the hill from its old glory days. Not recommended highly.",4

She said let's go... we grab a cab and 10 minutes later we are sitting in a movie set of an old style Singapore restaurant surrounded with some of the best food I have ever eaten.

I not only go there frequently but take many overseas visitors. The food and service have always been great. However, I've noticed a very sharp drop in service standards on the last couple of trips. The service staff appears to be very surly - almost as if they've been instructed to be so. They've started hustling and are unhappy if you don't order whatever overpriced dishes they are trying to push. No one in my family eats fish head and many are allergic to seafood. But when I ordered other meats and wouldn't order seafood dishes and fish head curries, our waiter wouldn't take no for an answer and kept insisting I order some. It was quite irritating. A pity because the food still remains decent. I'm heading to Banana Leaf Apollo the next time!",2

Place looks pretty good but for some unknown reason they dimmed the lights in the main dining room halfway through the meal. Staff members who took our orders were impatient and unhelpful. They rattled on with the options without any pauses or checks to see if we understood what they were saying. When we asked for opinions on portion size for our party (eg. if we should order M or L portions, or if they reckon we‚Äôve ordered too much etc.), the lady gave me an answer to which she might as well have shut up. She answered ‚Äúit depends (on each individual)‚Äù. I have never been to a Chinese restaurant and be spoken to like this. Most restaurants would give suggestion and inform you that you may order more later if you deem the food are insufficient for your party. More over her eyes were roaming, she was unfocused, and didn‚Äôt offer to give any suggestions whatsoever (I‚Äôd appreciate even if she was upselling). Food was not special, pretty average. Could easily get the same quality at any other Chinese restaurant. We asked for chillies and soya sauce and the China Chinese lady asked for exactly how many portions we require, and gave us measly portions. When we needed more (this is Singapore, everything we eat goes with chilli), she pointed out there are some left on our lazy Susan. WHAT!?? Would I not know how much chilli I need or are the chilli from your personal stash that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reluctant to give me more!?!! Did I mention they forgot to key in one of the dishes into the system so we waited and waited but it never came. When we asked, she said she forgot to key in and DID NOT EVEN APOLOGISE. End of meal, we got them to serve our cake. They cut it ruining every piece served. I should have taken some photos. Every time we tried to get some service, we were ignored. Being busy doesn‚Äôt mean you can ignore your guests. An acknowledgment and informing me to wait a moment would be much appreciated. Didn‚Äôt happen. But we noticed the table beside us had a dedicated server throughout their dinner as though someone was on standby for them throughout. Maybe it was a regular customer but aren‚Äôt we all paying the same price and we could have become a regular customer as well, no? Anyhow, you lost my vote. Whole experience was ruined by the crap service, seeing how we were excited to try this place. Never coming back here. And urge all not to.",1

Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant,"290 Orchard Road The Paragon #05-42/45, Singapore 238859 Singapore",Skytan7,"July 31, 2017","The peking duck is decent but definitely not michelin star standard (try the one at Four Seasons, crystal jade golden palace or if you're in Beijing Da Dong). Other dishes like the salted egg prawn, tofu with conpoy are ok but do not standout. Service is ok, despite being busy the staff did make the effort to top up the tea, check if our food arrived on time. However, prices are high in comparison to the quality you are getting. The only draw for me previously was the free corkage but with the new corkage charges I see little reason to visit, especially when other Chinese restaurants I visit usually waive my corkage. I would advise the management to be more flexible: waive the corkage if the guest is already spending a lot on food or charge corkage for 1 bottle and give the other complimentary. No point trying to push wines in your wine list where the prices are even more expensive than more established restaurants such as Les Amis and not worth the quality. ",3

The duck never disappoints, but on more than several occasions service has disappointed us enough to dampen the experience. We visited the establishment today and noticed a lack of service staff in the room we were assigned with several other tables. That was not a problem as we understood manpower issues but we were stunned when service staff were incompetent. When asking about some dishes on the dim sum menu, the staff actually replied that she ""seldom views the dimsum menu"" and therefore could not assist us. We had to wait 10 minutes for a manager to take our order, since the servers could not assist us in that aspect, even as the lunch crowd was winding down at around 2.30pm. When enquiring as to why the Tieguanyin tea we had was rather watery, the same senior staff who told us she was unfamiliar with the dimsum menu, and yet did not seek help otherwise, told us that ""That's how Tieguanyin is supposed to be"" and appeared to have an attitude. I have to mention that it appears to be that it is only this common room that is problematic, since our service experiences in the private rooms have been stellar. On a previous occasion, staff even gave us the wrong dish (we had chosen to have the remaining duck cooked into E-fu noodles, and staff brought us a plate of carelessly butchered duck carcass. When corrected, staff had the gall to say ""It must be your lucky day then."" How shocking.) Do hope that the next time round we have lunch here, service will be better than dismal for a restaurant that is supposed to be premium in all aspects. ",3

The dim sums are good quality and there is a wide variety. Service can be haphazard depending on where you are sitting. This is a huge restaurant and you might be stuck in an area without much servers' traffic.

Service was good although the servers did not speak much English and none of us knew any local language. The remaining duck was served plain or (extra cost) with either fried rice or noodles.

Why not? Alex is right. I go to Imperial Treasure-Peking Duck regularly, but it has been clear on more than one occasion that the noodles, which one pays for as a supplementary course,"" does not contain meat from the duck purchased, as promised. The noodles are close to awful, in fact. This practice is completely unacceptable. The next time I go, I will ask them to allow me to take the duck home (it is normal for people in Sg to take home food from a Chinese restaurant), and order something else, such as noodles from the menu. I hope that management will respond to these concerns - it is clearly illegal for this restaurant to substitute completely bland nothing meat for the duck customers have paid for. Otherwise the duck is better than any I have had in Asia.",3

This place is really elegant even though it's located inside of a mall. The chef carves tableside and you're encouraged to dip the perfectly crisp skin in the sugar.

Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant,"290 Orchard Road The Paragon #05-42/45, Singapore 238859 Singapore",LamN_12,"September 17, 2016","Since it first opened, this place has been serving the best Peking duck in Singapore. The duck is even better than at its newer sister outlet at Asia Square. They serve each guest one piece of crispy skin, and then the skin and meat from the breast together for wrapping, instead of skin and meat separately like at some other restaurants. The rest of the meat can be prepared in a second dish; we prefer the on-the-bone, deep fried version (with salt and garlic), but the minced meat with lettuce is also scrumptious. Other dishes are also excellent, eg. charcoal-grilled lamb shoulder, crispy chicken stuffed with glutinous rice, steamed fish, etc. Probably the best among the Imperial Treasure restaurants. Pro-active service by a loyal staff, who REMEMBER old customers like us by name, but treat all patrons with the same courtesy and efficiency. If this place had a longer wine list (to cater to ang moh) and were not located in a shopping mall, it might have garnered a Michelin star - although the latter's first Singapore edition was heavily biased in favour of restaurants that had already received a star elsewhere (Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc).",4

Let me start - the Peking duck here is good. It's not bad and tasty but is it really that much better than other places ? That is not really clear. The other dishes are ok but nothing here stands out ... The reason why this place loses out is that the service here is horrible. Try bring wine here (and paying corkage of $30+) and having the staff have no idea about how to open and serve the wine. God forbid you have more than one bottle and have the different wines poured in the same glass. This kind of service (not to mention the hair that found itself in our noddles) just means I can't give this place a good review. Note that I have been here many times (not by choice ) and have never been amazed by the place. ,2

When you don‚Äôt give in to her pushy sales, she shows her impatience and rushes you to make your meal decisions like you are damn poor but wants to eat at this prestigious place. I don‚Äôt know man, honestly speaking the neighbourhood Zhi char restaurant staffs possess more humane attitude than this bunch of staffs. The only pleasant staffs were the 2 local female students that seems to be working part time, very attentive and polite. With all that said, there were lots of empty tables at the time that we visited and hence, I see no reason for them to be impatient and rude in the service rendered.

We had chilli crab, crab with black pepper, crab in soup with noodles and coconut milk plus a couple of other dishes without crab. We all had beer, and I discovered the custom to add a splash of Guinness to Tiger beer. There was so much pleasure joining in on this feast, our hands covered in crab and sauce, our faces smeared with the same, with everyone just loving the food. I loved it here.

That means we go a long way back with this restaurant. This New Year evening as we queued at 5.30 pm, we were hurried through our orders. Spoken to in condescending manner by both the young man who spoke Malaysian-accented Mandarin as well as by the impatient female Supervisor who refused to give eye contact because we were slow. We couldn‚Äôt understand their confusing ‚Äú procedure‚Äù of orders in order to get seated at a Table, or waiting til our party is complete before having our orders sent to the kitchen. They were both too impatient to explain . They kept moving on to other customers while we were trying to clarify. Our food order took several attempts. I felt sneered at when we explain our smaller portion order of pork etc was because while our table was for 8 adults, the two Muslim Helpers can only eat non-pork dishes. I‚Äôve never felt so insulted before in any other same price restaurant in better venues. As a point of interest, the two crabs we ordered cost $165. The two stars I‚Äôve given is only for the food. Nothing else for rude service. It will be the last time I‚Äôm fulfilling my crab cravings at Melben. For the price we paid for the entire meal, we could have eaten at an air conditioned restaurant served by professional servers. We didn‚Äôt even bother to give Mr Boon Chuan the feedback.

We went there at 6:15pm on a Monday and there was no queue, but then it really started getting crowded by around 7pm. Order was placed almost immediately after I chose the crabs, and they showed me the exact amount (less drinks) I was going to pay - a good way to avoid argument over the size and portion. Pls also note they only take food order once, i.e. can't add dishes (I think to avoid people lingering at the table pondering about what to order next). So you'd better make up your mind early.

I sat outdoors and you are near hustling and bustling Serangoon Road. There is also an indoor seating and dining area upstairs. I had palaak paneer (a spinach dish), basmati rice, onion naan and a mango lassi the first time I went there. The second time I went there I had dal (a lentil dish), basmati rice, onion naan and a strawberry lassi. The food and service were very good. The server explained to me the difference between ""Deepawali"" and ""Diwali"". Both words are used for the Festival of Lights but ""Deepawali"" is used in South India and ""Diwali"" is used in North India. So I learned something in addition to the delicious food.",5

But I have mostly gotten delivery from this restaurant. They claim to deliver throughout Singapore, please do not fall for this. They never use the delivery features of Grab or Deliveroo or Food Panda and they are pathetic in the delivery. A promised time of 45 min can easily become 1.5 h to 1 h 45 min. You will be waiting for the food for ever. The food is fairly okay, not fantastic or anything. That is why I stopped at 2 stars",3

We decided on Khansama as we had read very good reviews of the restaurant, friendly staff and extremely tasty food!! The restaurant itself has an undercover eating area downstairs and an upstairs air conditioned dining area. The menu is extensive (perhaps too many options) with all the usual suspects you‚Äôd expect from an Indian restaurant. We ordered some onion bhajia and samosa to start, followed by Butter Chicken, Korma and Tikka Masala curries with plain rice, roti and naan. I must be missing something though. For me, the food was ordinary where the taste didn‚Äôt meet the expectation! The Korma sauce for example tasted more like ‚Äúhot milk‚Äù whilst everything seemed to have a hint of being ‚Äúsmoked‚Äù!! The restaurant itself was also very dirty especially the tables whilst the toilets were disgusting - don‚Äôt go unless you absolutely have too! Yes the staff were friendly and yes, you could sit there and soak up the atmosphere but the restaurant and meal (for me) were a huge disappointment! There are plenty of other restaurants up and down the road - next time, we shall try one of them!! ",3

Taking a stroll down the narrow streets and seeing all the 22cart gold makes one hungry!! So we decided on this place as it was 'traditional'. We ordered 2 soft drinks and proceeded to check out the menu, with a waiter hovering over us the whole time!!! These decisions can't be rushed!!!!Veg Pakora to start and some poppadom ....covered in tomato, onion and chilli when I clearly said no chilli, but hubby enjoyed and I shook the stuff off. Mains came, chicken tikka masala, (for Hubby)king prawn biryani, (for me)rice and 2 garlic naan bread. Nearly blew the head off my husband who loves hot spicey food!!!! Way toooooo hot for a masala dish!!! My prawns were hot too for my liking but I added the natural yogurt from the poppadom to mine and it was bearable. Unfortunately hubby's got the better of him and he had to give up!!! and I'm sure I asked for half servings, (which they advertised in their menu). So such a waste of money and at $99.80 Singapore dollars, it was a brave chunk of money. Also dont get me started on the toilet!!!! Unisex with a toilet bowl, a urinal and a shower hose!!! Floor was soaked, pubic hair and pee on the seat...(was desperate so hovered clutching tightly to my shorts!!) and the smell!!!!! I came out SCRUBBED my hands and made disgusting faces too hubby who refrained from using it!!!

Having spent 2 weeks in Singapore eating local food wherever possible we were expecting a good meal especially as the prices were higher than those we have typically used to. I had chicken Korma which was tasteless and the chicken(if that was what it was) was chewy and fatty. My husband ordered chicken biryani which was an absolute insult to the chicken. Full of bones, wings, skin and fat it was truly the worst meal ever. The best things were the naan breads but if you can‚Äôt get that right you may as well not bother. My daughter ordered the butter chicken which seemed marginally better than the other meals. In fairness to the manager having listened to our complaint he did offer us another meal. However we had seen enough and agreed we would pay for the food and drinks we had consimed Also, something to bear in mind is that all prices shown are then subject to a 10% service charge which is a bit of a joke and then 6% GST. As such, the items we paid for which included only one main meal, 3 x naan breads, 2x poppadoms and 3 x soft drinks came to a total of S$ 47.00 oh and it was plastic chairs and plastic plates !!!",1

To say I was disappointed was fair as the service was so poor. The staff who showed us to the table and give us the menu and the waitress who took our order and served us did not even try to conjure up a smile or a lively tone of voice. We joked about how they must be too cool to smile. Everything was done with little interest and I felt I was intruding them somehow. It was grouchy face all around with no eye contact. We initially wanted to stay for dessert and coffee but decided to leave as we would rather not see their faces anymore. The cashier was slightly friendly but did not even thank us when he returned the credit card. How ridiculous! The food was fair, not great and definitely not something I would come back for.

For main course, we ordered Gnocchi and spaghetti bolognese with minced meat. The portions were a tad small but the sauce was outstanding, the pasta perfectly done and the mince meat just the right amount of tender. We also ordered some Bira Moretti beer, a tad crude and harsh on the palette and did not go well with the dishes. Service was stretched but did not too badly. Reservation is advised.",4

Not anymore!! Now it seems more focused on making a buck than on the quality of their food. The skin of steamed chicken tasted awful ... like it was from an old batch ie probably cooked too early in the morning - we were there at 1pm. The rice portion size was small and pathetic and lacked the fragrance and taste of the traditional/original Boon Tong Kee famous chicken rice. They charged you $5 for a small single portion of chicken. And then charged you separately an additional $1 for a loosely packed triangle of rice. Plain water $1...what a joke. Daylight robbery. I can see that they are now more focused on the China tourists as there were lot of such tourists arriving on SUVs. It is no longer our local Boon Tong Kee chicken rice which used to be frequented by locals and taxi drivers, when it was run by the old owners.

Overall, this is well recommended, but one thing we have to notice, at Boon Tong Kee, the Hainan Rice is not served with clear Soup like in any other Restaurant.",4

Prawns are quite expensive - at $48++ a dish - and not as good as at Crystal Jade, Imperial Treasure, etc. Different people have different tastes, but I don't understand why there's often a queue at Boon Tong Kee, while less well-known Five-star Hainanese Chicken Rice a few doors away is often half-full; its kampong chicken is smaller, but more flavorful. For take-away, Five-Star is definitely better; you call, and when you come they even have change (from $20, $30, $40, or $50, etc) ready.
